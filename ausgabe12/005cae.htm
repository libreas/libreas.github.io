    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">BOBCATSSS, an annually organised symposium, always 
              indicates new and undogmatic trends and challenges for information 
              science and librarianship.<br>
              BOBCATSSS 2008 was my first conference on these subjects and as 
              a member of one of the organising institutions I was involved in 
              different activities and had different roles to play, as an organizer, 
              as a moderator and of course as a visitor. Finally, I was involved 
              as a critical reporter from the public relations group cooperating 
              with the LIBREAS team. Now I have the possibility to give an insider 
              report dealing with the content, topics and the subject of the symposium 
              &#8220;Access to Information for Everyone&#8221;. So what is going 
              on in the young community of librarians and information professionals? 
            </p>
            <p class="text">From the point of view of Claudia Lux (the second 
              keynote speaker) librarians and libraries have to become more visible. 
              Thus I want to show topics librarians were occupied with at the 
              symposium. Taking into account that some panels, lectures and workshops 
              I participated in dealt with a kind of awareness training concerning 
              new digital tasks for librarians, I felt there was some fear that 
              librarians would become old fashioned. To exemplify this, I want 
              to demonstrate these fears with regard to the following events:</p>
            <h3>Information 
              literacy strategies in the digital age</h3>
            <p><span class="text"> Maggie Fieldhouse from the University College 
              in London (UCL) presented a very interesting workshop. She focussed 
              on lots of problems librarians have to face nowadays concerning 
              information literacy. She was involved in a research project about 
              this topic at the Centre for Information Behaviour and the Evaluation 
              of Research at the UCL. In the age of search engines information 
              behaviour is changing. But do we really know how search engines 
              work? We need to! Chaotic information seeking behaviour is contradictive 
              to the systematic approach librarians have.<br>
              Another topic of the workshop was the &#8220;copy and paste phenomenon&#8221;. 
              The problems of using these techniques are the &#8220;loose of contextual 
              meaning, plagiarism and misuse of others' intellectual property&#8221;<span>[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">]. 
              Especially undergraduates are not aware of these consequences. So 
              what possibilities are there to teach pupils information literacy 
              in the digital age? Another point with regard to information literacy 
              in the education debate is: Which information is good enough to 
              cite? Is there anybody who wants to take responsibility to decide 
              that?</span></p>
            <p class="text"> Beside the topic of &#8220;Information Literacy in 
              Education&#8221; another workshop group dealt with the subject &#8220;Digital 
              Literacy &#8211; the Net Generation&#8221;. This group concluded 
              that young people very often know better than old people how to 
              work with so called Web 2.0 technologies even if the old people 
              were librarians or university teachers of information science. This 
              means the other way around: lecturers have to become pupils again 
              if they want to stay in touch with the information seeking and information 
              creating behaviour of the ne(x)t generation. This also includes 
              use of blogs, wikis and other Web 2.0 applications.</p>
            <h3>Panel Web 
              2.0 / Web 3.0</h3>

              <p>A similar disorientation as in the &#8220;Digital Literacy&#8221; 
              workshop could be seen at the Web 2.0 / Web 3.0 panel. Librarians 
              have to raise the awareness of Web 2.0 technologies and especially 
              how these technologies could be implemented in libraries. Librarians 
              have to develop a professional attitude and methods to evaluate 
              the utility of Web 2.0 software for their institutions and their 
              customers.</p>

              <p>Another important point for the status of library science is challenging 
              authorities by using weblogs. Blogs, this was the opinion of a panel 
              participant, give power to the masses. Is that problematic for the 
              knowledge authority of librarians? Librarians might be afraid that 
              in the future the customer will index the collection himself. How 
              librarians will handle that, especially the idea of sharing information, 
              is not to be foreseen. Is it about time now for libraries to share 
              their authority files with the public? What about social tagging? 
              Should this method be a way of complementing the library indexing? 
              Tom Roos (speaker) gave the ultimate forecast for the development 
              of the Web 2.0 topic (paraphrase):<br>
              <em>It is a new phenomenon. We do not know anything about the future 
              developments. We do not know anything about the tendencies, challenges 
              and about the question who will teach these technologies. We have 
              to find out which tools work adequately. We have to get aware of 
              what kind of contact users are interested in. Just experience what 
              is out there and test it!</em></p>
            <p><span class="text"><span class="textrot">&#8220;<a href="http://ealn.blogspot.com/" class="textrot">Everyone&#8217;s 
              a Librarian Now</a>&#8221;</span> was a workshop from Mark Clowes 
              and Matthew Borg of the Sheffield Hallem University dealing with 
              the Web 2.0 topic and its impacts for librarians in a more concrete 
              way. What would you as a reference librarian answer if a person 
              tells you: &#8220;I don't tend to use the reference books because 
              I can find answers on Google&#8221; or &#8220;I don't use the library 
              because I get emailed relevant articles from my friends.&#8221;<span>[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">] 
              You really have to be up to date and well prepared to answer to 
              such statements. It is necessary for librarians to be familiar with 
              social software (i.e. Web 2.0 applications) in order to make clear 
              to potential customers that the library is still important for them. 
              The three different groups of this workshop discussed what kind 
              of social software they would use e.g. for the selection of media. 
              They faced questions like:</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">&#8226; &#8220;What skills or expertise does 
              the librarian bring to the use of these tools?<br>
              &#8226; What issues may arise in implementing them?<br>
              &#8226; What will happen if librarians do not engage with them?&#8221;<span>[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">] 
              </span></p>
            <p class="text">In the further fruitful discussion some theoretical 
              consequences and statements were given. Libraries will become old 
              fashioned if they do not adapt or at least know how to use Web 2.0 
              technologies. Another statement was that libraries have to be reliable 
              and trustworthy. Librarians have to fight for their right to be 
              responsible for knowledge creation and dissemination. The workshop 
              concluded with the thesis: it is very important to develop a Web 
              2.0 model for the services of libraries.</p>
            <h3>What's next?</h3>

              <p>There is a generation gap in the world of information professionals. 
              How can we insist on the name information professional if we do 
              not know how undergraduates work with information?<br>
              Nowadays librarianship is on the one hand situated between the responsibility 
              to deal with information adequately, which also includes some kind 
              of authority, and on the other hand its necessity to open itself 
              for a discussion about integrating the public, sharing information, 
              giving users outside the library the right of expertise in information 
              authority as well. The function of the librarians needs to change. 
              Their main tasks will have to be to adjust open information flows 
              and bring them together under one interface to become useful and 
              reliable information. &#8216;Access to information for everyone&#8217; 
              intends that everyone should be able to decide about the relevance 
              of information. Consequently, everyone who accesses information 
              should have the ability to create and publish that information.</p>
            <p class="text">Even though everything concerning the challenges of 
              librarians in future is fluid, there is one thing that is for sure: 
              The roles of librarians between service providers, gatekeepers or 
              knowledge navigators are getting more and more complex everyday. 
              Librarians still maintain to be the only knowledge navigators or 
              gatekeepers of quality. But this is a fallacy. Librarians have to 
              be prepared that in a not so far away day they will have to compete 
              against potentially everyone with regard to information management.</p>
            <p class="text">These topics forecast new realities for the discipline 
              of librarianship. To face the problems and raise awareness to stay 
              on top with future developments is a useful starting point. Maybe 
              in the future the only difference between the librarian and everyone 
              is that the librarian will have the duty to keep the discourse on 
              information management going. In discussing the challenges of the 
              digital age one point at the BOBCATSSS 2008 symposium became significant: 
              As long as there are lively discussions about library trends librarians 
              are neither old fashioned nor dinosaurs in the information society. 
              Hopefully, the answers and agendas for action will follow.</p>
