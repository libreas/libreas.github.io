    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p>&#8220;[&#8230;] It&#8217;s hard to find library 
              materials that challenge the for-profit, corporate culture. Our 
              well-stocked county, community college, and university libraries, 
              though publicly funded, primarily serve private middle-class constituencies 
              &#8211; businesses, professions, students, job-seekers, and consumers. 
              There&#8217;s not much there for those who don&#8217;t share the 
              American Dream.&#8221; </span><span>[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span>]</span><span> 
              </span></p>
            <p class="text">In some circles a radical statement, in others, a 
              motivation for action. Zine libraries, infoshops, bookmobiles, street 
              libraries, and zine vending machines are all very different spaces 
              and ideas, but all with the same purpose to provide access to information 
              outside the corporate mainstream. I&#8217;m especially interested 
              in how people who don&#8217;t fit neatly into categories create 
              venues for their own access to information, specifically through 
              the establishment of zine libraries and infoshops.</p>
            <p class="text">Here&#8217;s the breakdown: A zine library is a collection 
              of zines (handmade books like the one you&#8217;re reading) organized 
              by zine-lovers and makers (often referred to as zinesters) in the 
              hopes of preserving and making accessible obscure materials. Since 
              most zines typically have runs of 1-500, each and every one is rare.</p>
            <p class="text">An infoshop is what its name implies: a place to go 
              for information. Infoshops are usually, but not always, run by anarchists, 
              but not necessarily for anarchists. They are volunteer-run non-hierarchical 
              spaces where people can go to for lectures, meetings, events, concerts, 
              and activist resources. Some infoshops house libraries and reading 
              rooms. Many have caf&eacute;s or at least a cup of tea available. 
              Infoshops sprung up in Europe and have caught on in the US in the 
              past fifteen years. Infoshops are ideal for activist travelers, 
              functioning as a place to stop in to find out where the coop is, 
              where to crash, and to find people with similar interests. They 
              usually have free internet access too.</p>
            <p class="text">The term &#8220;street library&#8221; hasn&#8217;t 
              caught on as much as &#8220;infoshop&#8221; has, but it is basically 
              the same idea with a twist. A street librarian is a one who doesn&#8217;t 
              leave the library when they leave the physical structure. Many librarians 
              who are also activists will offer their resource skills at protests 
              and events, and are able to bring their abilities wherever they 
              go. People can go to a street librarian to gain information on &#8220;underground&#8221; 
              activities and events. Although they&#8217;re hard to pin down, 
              when they&#8217;re around you&#8217;ll be sooo happy.</p>
            <p class="text">There are millions of inventive and creative ways 
              of getting resources and materials to the interested. Zine bookmobiles 
              and vending machines are some venues I&#8217;ve stumbled across. 
              Tool lending libraries and zine recycling programs are another. 
              It&#8217;s surprising how many new ways there are of exposing people 
              to self-published media. All of these resource centers have something 
              in common: The aim of fulfilling the need for access to materials 
              and information otherwise difficult to obtain. You won&#8217;t find 
              People magazine proudly showcased in these venues. I&#8217;m mainly 
              focusing on infoshops and zine libraries, as they are the most enduring 
              and organized forms of information centers, and have more evolved 
              methods of collection maintenance. It&#8217;s interesting to see 
              what happens when people who aren&#8217;t librarians by profession, 
              or even by education, get together to form a library or resource 
              center.</p>
            <h3>Why do these people need their own library? 
              Can&#8217;t they just go to the public or academic library?</h3>
            <p><span class="text">No. There&#8217;s a reason why so many alternative 
              libraries exist. There is a clear gap in the information world. 
              As stated above, most libraries keep to the middle of the road. 
              It is very hard to find any materials published outside the mainstream, 
              and especially hard to find materials that have been self-published 
              (zines and factsheets), or non-mainstream periodicals, newspapers 
              and tabloids. Also, infoshops and zine libraries tend to have later 
              hours, be connected with galleries, music show spaces, and other 
              resource venues such as darkrooms or screenprinting shops, as is 
              the case at ABC No Rio in New York City. It also seems these types 
              of libraries draw the paranoid, and rightfully so. Since the PATRIOT 
              Act was enacted, library records are no longer private information. 
              Activists and anarchists, and even sometimes artists are watched 
              by the FBI. Rather than give the government fodder to harass them, 
              through questionable library research, the use of a zine library 
              for information results in trackless searching. &#8220;In many groups 
              [&#8230;] there is an emphasis on self-education [&#8230;] Groups 
              often establish their own small &#8220;libraries&#8221; of relevant 
              books, periodicals and papers, sometimes in collaboration with a 
              local alternative bookshop or information centre. The rise of the 
              &#8220;infoshop&#8221; in recent years throughout Europe and the 
              US is one manifestation of such local activity. Usually based around 
              a local anarchist group, although it is of benefit to more than 
              anarchists, it acts as a communication and distribution point for 
              any number of local, national and international groups, movements 
              and projects [&#8230;] The infoshop emphasizes empowerment, providing 
              information freely (or very cheaply) to enable people to work together, 
              directly on issues that affect their lives.&#8221;<span> [<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">] 
              </span></p>
            <h3>
              What kind of spaces are they housed in? How could you possibly have 
              a library in a house or old gas station?</h3>
            <p><span class="text">The people organizing these types of places 
              aren&#8217;t going for glamorous. In most cases, they&#8217;re going 
              for whatever they can get. This is why you&#8217;ll find these libraries 
              in people&#8217;s living rooms, trucks, basements, in tenements, 
              galleries and student centers. Unless a non-profit organization 
              is backing the infoshop or library, be prepared for creative solutions 
              to space problems. Cheap rent in a bad neighborhood usually equals 
              a great place for an infoshop or zine library. &#8220;Besides financial 
              problems, neighborhood communication difficulties are common [...] 
              many infoshops are organized by white youth in communities populated 
              by minorities. The subculture that patronizes the shop [&#8230;] 
              sticks out in contrast to the surrounding neighborhood. Residents 
              may perceive the infoshop as a beach-head in the gentrification 
              happening in that town.&#8221;<span>[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">]</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">The Mobilivre out of Canada travels across the 
              continent in a stylish Airstream trailer, bringing zines and workshops 
              with them. The Anchor Archive Regional Zine Project in Nova Scotia 
              offers an artist-in-residence program where artists can stay in 
              a storage shed in the backyard for a few weeks to make a zine. A 
              few libraries accompany &#8220;Food Not Bombs&#8221;, an organization 
              in several cities handing out free food at different parks or public 
              areas weekly. In Japan, there are bunkos. &#8220;Typically run by 
              groups of women for their neighborhood children&#8221; [&#8230;] 
              bunko is a network of &#8220;tiny outposts which may be found in 
              homes, converted train cars, community centers, or even log cabins.&#8221; 
              <span>[<a name="f4b" id="f4b"></a></span></span><a href="#f4" class="back">Fn4</a><span class="text">]</span></p>
            <h3>What are in these libraries? How are they 
              run? How do they acquire materials if they&#8217;re anarchists? 
              I heard anarchists don&#8217;t like money.</h3>
            <p class="text">It&#8217;s true. They don&#8217;t. But some infoshops 
              sell things. Patches, t-shirts, books, videos, art, etc. Most places 
              operate collectively, which often involves paying out of collective 
              member&#8217;s pockets, and most frequently relying on donations 
              of materials from people with a lot of zines lying around, other 
              zine libraries with duplicates, or donations of cash. Zine-makers 
              tend to understand a zine library&#8217;s motives, and since they 
              aren&#8217;t making zines to make money anyway, feel great donating 
              their creation to the library. It provides another venue for a reader 
              to stumble across their hand-bound lovingly screenprinted handmade 
              book.</p>
            <p><span class="text">A way most libraries pay rent is through benefit 
              concerts or sometimes art auctions, or anything else that might 
              be fun and also raise money. In the case of the Papercut Zine Library, 
              the group of librarians was able to trade building labor for a free 
              room.<span>[<a name="f5b" id="f5b"></a></span></span><a href="#f5" class="back">Fn5</a><span class="text">] 
              Rarely are materials bought outright. Sometimes library dumpsters 
              are raided for discarded books, and also for organizational materials 
              (bookshelves, magazine racks, etc.) Dumpstering is a fantastic way 
              to get a lot of what you need for free. But that&#8217;s another 
              topic. However these libraries obtain their materials, almost all 
              ask the subject matter not be racist, sexist, or homophobic. Collective 
              action entails each member committing to the project, coming to 
              meetings and voting on each major decision, and each being equally 
              responsible to maintain the space, and everyone is also able to 
              plan events or enact ideas within the space. No one person is in 
              charge of a collective. A collective is a cooperative effort, which 
              if done with a certain amount of enthusiasm and respect for each 
              other, can work out fantastically. If those basic values aren&#8217;t 
              in place, there will be burn out, and the space could fail. Luckily, 
              people working on fun projects like zine libraries just want to 
              see the library succeed and grow, and they do!</span></p>
            <h3>How can you possibly organize information 
              that hasn&#8217;t already been cataloged by another person?</h3>

              <p>Easy. You make it up. This is where Sanford Berman would argue the 
              access part comes in. How easy is it to find this information? In 
              some instances, there is no organization. Your findings are left 
              up to fate, chance, and synchronicity. Which is great if your psychic 
              skills are honed. Several zine libraries stick to the alphabetical 
              system, but most zine libraries catalog by topic. If you go in to 
              the library searching for a good book on bicycle maintenance, you&#8217;ll 
              also find a zine on good routes to ride without getting hit, how 
              to weld your own tall bike, and riding safely, if you&#8217;re searching 
              the bicycling section. Since zine and infoshop library collections 
              tend to be radical in nature, their subject headings are unique. 
              DIY (do-it-yourself) is a HUGE category, with several subsets to 
              the category. A few others you won&#8217;t find in the public library 
              are- radical menstruation, squatting, dumpstering, protesting, XXX, 
              sustainable living, fat, and grrrls. The people cataloging this 
              material respond to their material through topics and organizational 
              methods appropriate for their subject matter. It&#8217;s important 
              to point out that although there are librarians by profession involved 
              in infoshops and zine libraries, most zine librarians are either 
              still in library school, or have never had any experience working 
              in a library at all. They just want to give people access to information 
              they might not even know was out there.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Take for instance the Papercut Zine Library, 
              in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<span>[<a name="f6b" id="f6b"></a></span></span><a href="#f6" class="back">Fn6</a><span class="text">] 
              Even though this library is housed in the Harvard Social Hall, in 
              the same neighborhood as some of the world&#8217;s biggest and best 
              libraries, this library is thriving. There is obviously a need within 
              the community for zines and all the information they contain and 
              offer. With over 2,000 zines organized by topic on small shelves, 
              and an online searchable catalog, the volunteer zine librarians 
              running the place have figured out how to catalog and organize their 
              material without burying it underneath unsearchable databases or 
              vague subject headings. None of these libraries use cataloging terminology 
              or systems. None of them have scanable barcodes, use the LC or Dewey 
              Decimal systems. I&#8217;m sure they have never once consulted the 
              Library of Congress subject headings to make sure they&#8217;re 
              using the appropriate heading for the zine on home dentistry. Most 
              record which zine or book belongs in what section, maintain a list 
              of what they have and what gets checked out, if theirs in a circulating 
              collection, and forget the rest. The extents to which the digital 
              cataloging systems go are Filemaker or LibraryThing, making the 
              catalog available online. It&#8217;s important to realize that even 
              though these zine librarians aren&#8217;t trained in cataloging, 
              they&#8217;ve merged systems that have already been invented with 
              their own original systems.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Although each system is different-some might throw 
              zines into a box and let you sort through, some cut the tops off 
              cereal boxes for organizational systems, and some have book racks, 
              displaying items more like a store, all have invented innovative 
              ways of cataloging and finding the material.</p>
            <h3>Who uses zine libraries? How do they find 
              out about them?</h3>
            <p class="text">Anyone who wants to access information not available 
              at their public library uses zine libraries or infoshops. Anyone 
              interested in zines, underground publishing, little magazines, one-offs, 
              tabloids, art, quirks, or free speech in general are excited by 
              zine libraries. Researchers, students, zinesters, artists, old hippies 
              and beatniks, those on the political left and outfield use them. 
              Zine libraries and infoshops don&#8217;t advertise in newspapers 
              or magazines because they&#8217;re poor. They&#8217;re found through 
              word of mouth, posters put up in co-ops, bike shops and on telephone 
              poles. There are a few websites about zines that mention library 
              locations. They are often moving and sadly closing. But new ones 
              are always opening, in different forms. The Zine Machine, for instance, 
              is a vending machine with zines inside. For a dollar or two you 
              can have your own zine to take home. Some are in university libraries, 
              and they are much more organized and professional-looking and operating, 
              which is why I didn&#8217;t choose to focus on them here. Some libraries 
              are connected to other ventures, and if you look, or go to any zine-related 
              event (store, reading, zine fair), you&#8217;ll be sure to find 
              a trail to the zine library or infoshop.</p>
            <h3>How do the libraries attract users? Who are 
              these libraries geared toward? Do I have to pay to get in?</h3>
            <p class="text">Other than word of mouth, libraries will often bring 
              cross-sections of their collection for on-site checkout to zine 
              fairs and events, anarchist book fairs, or to zine and book readings 
              in the punk community. The libraries aren&#8217;t necessarily geared 
              toward anarchists or punks, but due to the radical materials and 
              DIY ethics of zines, these groups are a large user base. These libraries 
              are frequented by anyone interested in the subjects they cover, 
              and most importantly, it is almost always free to check out a book 
              or zine, if they don&#8217;t think their collection is too valuable 
              or rare to let off-site. It is because of this idea of libraries 
              for all that such a wide variety of people are drawn to the zine 
              library or infoshop.</p>
            <h3>Are zine libraries really libraries? I don&#8217;t 
              know about this...</h3>
            <p class="text">Zine librarians take the stance that if anyone says 
              it&#8217;s a library, it is. If Duchamp can say found objects are 
              art, zine librarians spending hours cataloging and organizing ephemera 
              and oddities can call themselves librarians and their creations 
              libraries. In this sense, anyplace that provides access to information 
              in a somewhat organized or searchable form, can be considered a 
              library. The word library seems so authoritative and smarty-pants. 
              Zine librarians are taking the word and applying its meaning to 
              a wide range of information resources, including a roomful or bagful 
              of books or zines. </p>
            <p><span class="text">I do hope that zine libraries and infoshops 
              grow in popularity and use. I hope that the collectives running 
              them find reliable methods of funding so fewer are closing. And 
              I do hope that public libraries will become hip to the idea of zines 
              and alternative/non-mainstream periodicals and other materials. 
              Some are starting to realize what a valuable resource they are in 
              terms of documenting cities, contemporary culture and events otherwise 
              not covered by the media. However, there will always be a need and 
              space for infoshops and zine libraries. No matter how much information 
              makes it into public and academic libraries, unless these libraries 
              are suddenly taken over by zine librarians, the board of directors 
              booted, and the institutions are run collectively, zine libraries 
              and infoshops will be filling the information gap in storefronts, 
              garages and shacks.</span></p>
