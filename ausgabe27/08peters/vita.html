<p><strong>Alison Peters</strong> is currently obtaining her MLIS from <a href="http://ischool.sjsu.edu/"><em>San Jose State
University’s iSchool</em></a>; earned a B.A. in
English from <a href="http://berkeley.edu/"><em>UC Berkeley</em></a>; and, when not
working, querying, or in class, puts her M.F.A. from <a href="http://www.mills.edu/"><em>Mills
College</em></a> to good use and shares her love for all
things bookish on <a href="http://bookriot.com/"><em>Book Riot</em></a>. She was inspired
to write for LIBREAS by the memory of her grandfather, a self-taught
German-speaking African American who, the story goes, translated for
Albert Einstein at a <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/"><em>California Institute of Technology (Cal
Tech)</em></a> lecture in 1931. You can find her
serious professional side on LinkedIn.</p>
