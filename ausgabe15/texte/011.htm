    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">As libraries move away from collections-based models 
              toward access-based models, with online catalogues, digital book 
              collections, and online journal subscriptions, their websites take 
              on greater importance. It is fast approaching the point where a 
              library has as great a presence with their website as with their 
              physical building, if not more. It is therefore imperative that 
              a library&#8217;s website is logical, helpful, and user-friendly. 
              Carole A. George, in User-Centred Library Websites: Usability Evaluation 
              Methods, argues that libraries need to create user-centred websites 
              and involve users in their creation to ensure such websites are 
              user-friendly.</p>
            <p class="text" > User-Centred Library Websites is a guide to various 
              usability evaluation techniques employed in designing user-centred 
              websites. Libraries wishing to create a new website or to update 
              their existing one would do well to consult George&#8217;s book 
              for ideas on how to involve end-users in the website creation and 
              testing process to make the most of their web presence.</p>
            <p class="text" > George begins in Chapter 1 by defining user-centred 
              design. &#8220;Simply stated, user-centred design refers to how 
              easy a product, website or computer-based system is to use based 
              on the users&#8217; perceptions&#8221; (p.3). The author touches 
              upon why libraries need user-centred websites, citing changing user 
              needs and increasing numbers of online services that libraries provide. 
              If users do not find a website easy to use, they will move onto 
              other sites, thus the library&#8217;s web presence diminishes. George 
              moves on to how to get started in Chapter 2, such as by assembling 
              a development team, setting evaluation plans and goals, and recruiting 
              participants. Since user-friendliness hinges upon the users&#8217; 
              perceptions, the author argues in Chapter 3 that libraries need 
              to conduct a user needs analysis in order to ascertain the end-users&#8217; 
              computer skills, knowledge, goals for using the website, tasks they 
              desire to accomplish, and their expectations. George details the 
              processes involved in surveys, questionnaires, and interviews.</p>
            <p class="text" > In Chapter 4, she urges libraries to include users 
              in the website development cycle to provide timely feedback and 
              to inform the design process. Users can participate in the early 
              design stages through affinity diagramming, card sorting, and prototyping. 
              George&#8217;s suggestion of card sorting is an excellent one, since 
              participants organize website information, such as documents and 
              links, into categories and labels that make sense to them as end-users. 
              Far too often, library websites are organized according to a librarian 
              perspective and are not as useful to end-users as they could be. 
              A librarian&#8217;s tolerance for information overload is greater 
              than the average person&#8217;s.</p>
            <p class="text" > In Chapter 5 George explains how inspection methods 
              can be used to test the usability of a website. For example, heuristic 
              evaluations require expert reviewers to judge a website based upon 
              a set of usability standards. Expert reviewers can also inspect 
              a website with cognitive walkthroughs, where they complete tasks 
              on prototypes and estimate how end-users would fare.</p>
            <p class="text" > The meat of the book takes place in Chapter 6, concerning 
              usability testing. Here George provides helpful advice on how to 
              create effective task scenarios, which are commonly used in usability 
              testing. Participants are given real life scenarios to complete 
              tasks that test the website&#8217;s functions. George advises to 
              pair scenarios with each website objective, to write the scenarios 
              in the users&#8217; language, to keep the scenarios short as opposed 
              to writing a long set of instructions, and to arrange the scenarios 
              in a logical order. In this chapter, the author also provides tips 
              on how to conduct usability sessions. Examples include suggested 
              questions facilitators could choose to prompt participants to think 
              aloud during the sessions. Having participated in usability testing 
              before, I can attest that facilitators are sometimes at a loss as 
              to how to prompt participants to think aloud, which can be awkward 
              for the participants to do. In my experience, the facilitator spoke 
              over the intercom, merely reminding me, &#8220;You&#8217;re not 
              thinking out loud enough!&#8221; George&#8217;s suggestions would 
              have better success eliciting the behavior facilitators would like 
              to see. It is curious however, that although George details the 
              materials and environments needed to conduct usability testing, 
              including video and audio recording equipment, she neglects to mention 
              eye-tracking software (Schiessl 2003, Jacob 2004), an emerging tool 
              in usability testing.</p>
            <p class="text" > The author ends the book with Chapter 7 on how to 
              communicate the findings, cataloging the characteristics of written 
              reports and presentations. In the appendix are examples of a recruiting 
              email, screening questionnaire, usability testing introduction, 
              scenario task sheet, post-test questionnaire, informed consent form, 
              and a heuristic evaluation form. The book includes a glossary of 
              terms and an index.</p>
            <p class="text" > For every method described in the book, George illustrates 
              what it is, what is the method&#8217;s objective, who are the participants, 
              how long it will take, what materials are needed, where the activity 
              is held, and what are the advantages and disadvantages. She also 
              provides examples of how to plan and facilitate each session. These 
              examples give the reader a picture of what the sessions will look 
              like and walk the reader through the stages of the sessions.</p>
            <p class="text" > Since every method is broken down and structured 
              around its objectives, advantages, and disadvantages, etc., the 
              text tends to repeat itself and uses similar language from method 
              to method. Reading the book straight through can become repetitive. 
              Because of this, the book reads less like a conventional discussion 
              and more like a reference guide. It seems to be ideally suited for 
              library staff who are conducting in-house usability studies and 
              who may have little experience facilitating such sessions. Any librarian, 
              regardless of experience, can turn to User-Centred Library Websites, 
              look up a method they would like to try, and refer to valuable advice, 
              tips, and examples of how to conduct the sessions. The examples 
              provided in the appendix are especially helpful to novice facilitators. 
              Not every librarian serving on a website design committee has had 
              experience writing an informed consent form, for example. One could 
              use the form George provides or model one after it to save time.</p>
            <p class="text" > The author seems to have had academic libraries 
              in mind when writing. She addresses universities and college libraries 
              (p.29), and not public libraries, for instance. This makes sense, 
              since the author comes from an academic library background. It should 
              be noted, however, that any librarian can adopt the methods in the 
              book, be they academic, public, school, archivist, or competitive 
              intelligence librarians. The methods range from very formal to informal, 
              with settings and equipment ranging from laboratories to office 
              spaces.</p>
            <p class="text" > Librarians serving on website design committees 
              would appreciate User-Centered Library Websites for its ideas on 
              the design process and usability testing in the creation of a user-friendly 
              website. By making sure their website is intuitive to end-users, 
              libraries can better meet their users&#8217; needs, and strengthen 
              their presence in the ever competitive web world.</p>
