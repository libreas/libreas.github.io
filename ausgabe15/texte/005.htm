<h3>Introduction</span></h3>
          
          <p class="text"> Informal learning environments (ILEs) such as public 
            libraries, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, and school-based child-care programs 
            provide supervision of children during afterschool hours. They are 
            said to perform important community functions such as providing 
            a safe, pro-social environment for their child participants. In 
            their 1982 essay, Patricia M. Greenfield and Jean Lave (Greenfield 
            &amp; Lave, 1982) suggest that, (in American settings), distinctions 
            between formal education (FE) and informal education (IE) may be 
            based on dichotomies associated with context, responsibility, intimacy, 
            curriculum, continuity, mode of learning, mode of instruction, and 
            social motivation. Along similar lines, Sylvia Scribner and Michael 
            Cole (Scribner &amp; Cole, 1973) draw distinctions between informal 
            learning and literacy and those competencies acquired in school. 
            Each of these authors maintains that it is useful to talk about 
            informal learning environments as contexts separate from school 
            due to their rich potential for supporting productive and transformative 
            learning. In addition to this work relating to informal learning 
            environments, a body of research concerned with new conceptions 
            of literacy as multi-modal, culturally situated practices has emerged. 
            Attempts to infuse learning designs with popular and youth cultures 
            have gained momentum &#8211; seeking to capture the potentiality 
            for more motivating and engaging learning contexts. As examples 
            of this line of inquiry, the new literacies work developed by Leu, 
            Kinzer and their extended workgroup (2004), the multiliteracies 
            pedagogical framework articulated by the New London Group (1996, 
            2000), the broadly based popular literacies work from Ann Haas Dyson 
            (1997, 2003), and research in digital environments from David Buckingham 
            (2003) provide a rich set of tools to think about learning design 
            and the content and rationale for technology integration and instruction 
            for informal learning environments. </p>
          <p class="text">Dyson&#8217;s important work integrating popular stories 
            with school-sanctioned narratives demonstrates how children can 
            use their cultural narratives as a base from which to work from 
            as they encounter school-sanctioned texts and diverse lifeworlds. 
            Finders (1997) also shows how girls&#8217; private, informal literacy 
            practices have real consequences for their social and emotional 
            development. In each of these cases, the author calls for popular 
            texts to be appropriated by classrooms to support not only skills 
            acquisition but to provide spaces where dialog and critique of popular 
            narratives can play out. Most afterschool ILEs incorporate popular 
            culture to a great extent. I think the goal achieved by Dyson was 
            the successful meshing of popular and adult-sanctioned texts through 
            reading, writing, artwork, and dramatic play. This work has influenced 
            my approach to learning design in that I attempt to use youth cultures 
            (as instantiated in popular games, play practices, and texts in 
            the Fifth Dimension) as textual gateways to new practices centered 
            around media, information, and computer literacy. In this paper 
            I illustrate how popular culture texts can lead to engaging and 
            transformative practice when infused in to the programming of an 
            afterschool informal learning environment. To do this I present 
            two examples of activities designed to leverage intertextual relationships 
            between popular and educative texts and practices to support information 
            and visual literacy.<a name="2"></a></p>

          <h3>Intertextuality</h3>
          <p class="text"> As a concept, intertextuality emerged from semiotic 
            theory (Kristeva, 1980) to describe the process by which individuals 
            come to know a particular text through their prior experiences with 
            other texts. Jay Lemke (1998) uses the concept of intertextuality 
            extensively to drive home the point that literacies are &#8220;always 
            social: we learn them by participating in social relationships; 
            their conventional forms evolved historically in particular societies; 
            the meanings we make with them always tie us back in to the fabric 
            of meanings made by others (Lemke, 1998, p.2).&#8221; The idea that 
            literacy learning is most effective when it is socially situated 
            and part of an intertextual chain of meanings (relevant to students) 
            gives researchers concerned with literacies in ILEs a new way of 
            thinking about the introduction of new practices.<a name="3"></a></p>

          <h3>A Strategy to Support Boundary Crossing</h3>

          <p> <span class="text">By introducing intertextuality as a (learning) 
            design element, I felt I could use popular culture/youth culture 
            narratives to initiate intertextual chains, creating new linkages 
            between popular texts and adult-sanctioned texts, competencies, 
            and ways of viewing the world. In this way, the intertextuality-infused 
            designs could be leveraged as a means of helping children &#8220;cross 
            boundaries&#8221; toward practices related to new literacies and 
            movement toward mastery of existing competencies. This notion of 
            boundary crossing is informed by concepts developed first by Susan 
            Leigh Star (Star, 1989; Star &amp; Griesemer, 1989) and further 
            developed by Yrjo Engestr&ouml;m (Engestr&ouml;m Y. &amp; Kakkainen 
            M, 1995), Terttu Tuomi-Gr&ouml;hn (Tuomi-Gr&ouml;hn &amp; Engestr&ouml;m, 
            2003), and Richard Edwards (Edwards, 2005). Much of this work describes 
            the processes of boundary crossing in which an individual moves 
            beyond their primary sets of professional practices and realms of 
            expertise. Along similar lines, the concept of boundary objects 
            has helped to articulate the ways in which tools and artifacts support 
            and provide infrastructures for such &#8220;crossings over&#8221; 
            between different communities of practice.</span></p>
          <p class="text">Boundary objects are those objects that both inhabit 
            several communities of practice and satisfy the informational requirements 
            of each of them. Boundary objects are thus both plastic enough to 
            adapt to local needs and constraints of the several parties employing 
            them, yet robust enough to maintain a common identity across sites. 
            (Bowker &amp; Star, 2000) I suggest that theories of boundary crossing 
            and boundary objects provide powerful means of conceptualizing and 
            describing the uptake of tools and new practices among child participants. 
            Considerations can be made about whether an activity design was 
            relevant as a tool to support learning by framing the issue in terms 
            of whether participants were engaged to the extent that they tried 
            something new or stretched their existing repertoires of practice. 
            Along similar lines, Etienne Wenger (1998) suggests that movement 
            between communities of practice is oftentimes mediated by brokers. 
            For Wenger, brokers are individuals that have expertise and relationships 
            located in multiple communities of practice and are willing to extend 
            practices found in one community toward individuals relegated to 
            a different sphere of expertise and participation.[Brokering] &#8230;requires 
            the ability to link practices by facilitating transactions between 
            them, and to cause learning by introducing into a practice elements 
            of another. Toward this end, brokering provides a participative 
            connection &#8211; not because reification is not involved, but 
            because what brokers press into service to connect practices is 
            their experience of multimembership and the possibilities for negotiation 
            inherent in participation. (Wenger, 1998, 109)</p>
          <p class="text"> Thus the goal of the project was to design activities 
            mediated by specially designed artifacts (intertextual taskcards 
            &#8211; to be described in depth later) and guided by adult brokers 
            (researchers and service learning students) to support boundary 
            crossing by the children toward new practices associated with digital 
            production and information and visual literacy. In the section that 
            follows, I will highlight the setting for this approach: a well-developed 
            afterschool program, the Fifth Dimension (5D), which has a fairly 
            long history of creating contexts for children&#8217;s access and 
            meaningful participation in activities related to new and basic 
            literacies.<a name="4"></a></p>

          <h3>Methodology</h3>
            
            <h4>Setting for the Study</h4>
          
          <p class="text"> The Fifth Dimension Project, begun by Michael Cole 
            and Peg Griffin in 1987, formed a university-community collaboration 
            that places undergraduate students from the fields of Psychology, 
            Communication, and Human Development in an afterschool program where 
            they worked as field ethnographers conducting qualitative research 
            while they engaged in homework help and educative play activities 
            with K-6 child participants. An experiment in informal leaning design, 
            Fifth Dimension research has influenced and drawn on work informed 
            by the Design Experiment approach initially introduced by Ann Brown 
            (1992). Like Brown and others associated with design experiment 
            research, the digital storytelling project described in this paper 
            supports new approaches to designing instructional activities while 
            contextualizing interventions within localized practices and contingencies.</p>
          
          <h4>Ethnographic Observations</h4>

          <p class="text"> Adult, undergraduate participants recorded much of 
            the activity as it enfolded in ethnographic fieldnotes. Undergraduates 
            (between 15 and 20) attended the Fifth Dimension at the Fair Hills 
            and Polvera Boys and Girls Clubs two times a week and authored fieldnotes 
            detailing their participation and interactions. Educative play activities 
            taking place at the sites included participation in: (a) console 
            and pc-based video gaming, (b) art projects, (c) board games, (d) 
            multimedia production projects, (e) web-based information seeking 
            and (e) web design. Hundreds of fieldnotes were collected during 
            the two and a half years of observation. I performed coding and 
            analyses allowing me to chart and characterize participation in 
            various activities through observations made by adult, undergraduate 
            participants in the Fifth Dimension.</p>

          <h4>Child Questionnaires and Interviews</h4>
          
          <p class="text"> Prior to participation in the Fifth Dimension sites, 
            children completed an application in which they provided biographical 
            information (e.g. name, age, gender, favorite movies/activities). 
            This application performed an instructional function in that it 
            organized a set of tasks for children to complete with their undergraduate 
            buddy which introduced them to activities related to searching the 
            web, digital photography, manipulating a computer, geography, etc. 
            Children were interviewed periodically concerning their web design 
            and video production projects. The digital audio recordings of these 
            interviews provided data which further informed my understanding 
            of how social transformations were articulated through participation 
            in activities integrating technology, information seeking, and multimedia 
            production.</p>

          <h4>Designworks </h4>
          
          <p class="text">Relevant artifacts for analysis included disks provided 
            to children (for saving desired games, webpages in progress, photos, 
            artwork, homework, letters, etc.), handwritten documents and artwork, 
            and multimedia production projects (e.g. digital stories). Content 
            from children&#8217;s disks was uploaded to folders on a server 
            at the end of each week. A separate folder was prepared weekly for 
            each child. The weekly children&#8217;s folders were then placed 
            in an aggregate &#8220;cohort&#8221; folder to render a complete 
            collection for each week. Artifacts produced in the Fifth Dimension 
            provide additional evidence that children engaged in particular 
            activities such as reading, writing, media production, and web design 
            during a particular timeframe. Because the Fifth Dimension provides 
            such a rich source of ethnographic observations, child questionnaires, 
            and examples of designworks to communicate these ideas, the research 
            design allowed for triangulation between data collected from observations 
            of children inscribed in fieldnotes, statements children made about 
            themselves (in applications and interviews), and designworks created 
            by children as part of their participation in the learning designs 
            that were part and parcel of this study.<a name="5"></a></p>

          <h3>Intertextual Designs in Action</h3>

          <p class="text"> In the sections that follow I highlight two cases 
            which demonstrate how intertextual gateways were infused in to the 
            design of activities for children in an afterschool learning environment. 
            The concept of intertextuality was applied to the design of an organizing 
            activity already common to the Fifth Dimension: the taskcard. For 
            the remainder of this chapter, I highlight two approaches I took 
            in developing new taskcards for the Fifth Dimension. First, using 
            video games as gateways to exploring web-based searching and digital 
            production, and second, using holiday activities to build visual 
            literacies. Over multiple ten week periods, our research sites at 
            the Fair Hills and Polvera Boys&#8217; &amp; Girls&#8217; Club introduced 
            one or two new taskcards every day. As mentioned previously, the 
            taskcard designs incorporated Kristeva&#8217;s notion of intertextuality 
            in that youth cultures were understood as texts that could be strategically 
            leveraged to initiate intertextual chains of meaning towards new, 
            educative texts and practices (see Figure 1).</p>

           <p align="center">Figure 1 Anatomy of an intertextual taskcard</p>
         </div>

          <p class="text">I focus first on the case of Skyler (10 years old), 
            who, through participation in the intertextual learning design activities 
            (brokered by an undergraduate service learning student) built competencies 
            related to information and computer literacy and producing a personal 
            webpage. The second case involves the use of taskcards designed 
            to leverage children&#8217;s interest in a popular American holiday, 
            Halloween, to support engagement in activities related to building 
            visual literacies. Halloween occurs in October and involves the 
            carving of pumpkins (a type of squash) which are illuminated with 
            candles. Children dress up in costumes and walk door to door begging 
            for candy &#8211; a practice called &#8220;trick-or-treating.&#8221; 
          </p>
          <h4>Games as Intertextual Gateways: 
            Supporting Information Literacy and Digital Production</span></h4>
          <p class="text"> The activity design as shown below at the Fair Hills 
            Boys and Girls Club Fifth Dimension was organized around a &#8220;taskcard&#8221; 
            format (common to the 5D) with beginner, good, and expert levels 
            of expertise. The activities took participants through increasingly 
            complex tasks grounded in children&#8217;s participation in a popular 
            pc-based video game, &#8220;Zoo Tycoon&#8221;. The &#8220;Zoo Tycoon 
            Activity Page&#8221; represents a second Zoo Tycoon taskcard for 
            children to choose from, thus providing another set of activities 
            related to the popular game. At the beginner level, the child extends 
            the context of the game toward the goal of finding tips and hints 
            on the web and testing their viability in the game. At the good 
            level, the child tests and saves their tips and hints into an electronic 
            file. Finally, at the expert level, the participant inserts this 
            file into a personal webpage.</p>

          <p><span class="text">In the fieldnote that follows, an undergraduate 
            describes an interaction that was guided by the taskcard describe 
            above. This &#8220;intertextual&#8221; taskcard was designed to 
            support the acquisition of information literacy by supporting the 
            child&#8217;s movement beyond participation in a favorite video 
            game to practices related to searching the web, reading text on 
            a computer screen, and the critical application of information found 
            through the search process. Skyler (a 10 year old boy) visited the 
            Fifth Dimension after school with his sister Melissa. I asked Skyler 
            if he knew what a search engine was. He said that he didn't, and 
            I explained that it was a website you go to in order to search for 
            things. I showed him how the search results were of websites based 
            on the subject he typed in. We went to several of the links in order 
            to find one that had some tips on it. We found one, and I asked 
            Skyler if he knew how to copy and paste selections. He said he didn't, 
            and I instructed him on how to do so. I told him to highlight what 
            he wanted to copy, and he did so <br>
            &#8230;Skyler found another one on a website and became excited, 
            turning to Raymond sitting to his left and explaining the code to 
            him with a jazzed tone of voice. Skyler copied and pasted the new 
            codes into the Notepad document, then we spent some time reading 
            the next directions on the task card [NED: 11/9/04]</span></p>
          <p class="text">In the example above, the undergraduate was able to 
            extend one child&#8217;s agenda for playing a video game toward 
            more educative practices. Movement from a context bound by the game 
            itself to one where the child became engaged with new practices 
            (related to working with virtual objects, searching the web, and 
            applying relevant information to a set of problems) was accomplished 
            through processes of &#8220;intertextual chaining&#8221;. At the 
            Expert level of taskcard Skyler came to build a webpage via completion 
            of the Zoo Tycoon taskcard (see figure 2). We were looking for a 
            computer when Maria asked Skyler if he wanted to build a webpage. 
            Skyler agreed so Maria and I went to look for the task card for 
            Microsoft Front Page.We went on the web and looked for an image 
            of Zoo Tycoon. Skyler picked one and I showed him how to save it 
            onto the hard drive. Just then Maria came over and suggested we 
            save it onto the disk. The picture Skyler had chosen was too small 
            and it was replicated all over his background page. He didn't like 
            it so we were going to open it up in paint and see if we could make 
            it bigger but when we opened up his disk, Maria saw that he had 
            an old picture of the Lord of the Rings and he opted for that one 
            instead. He made the picture bigger in Paint and then opened it 
            up in Front Page, as a background. By this time Skyler knew how 
            to open it up the background on his own. Then we went to Word Art 
            under Insert on the menu and he picked the design and the title 
            of his page: Lord of the Rings. We then went online again to Google 
            and searched for pictures of the lord of the rings. For these pictures, 
            it didn&#8217;t matter if they were small because we could adjust 
            them. He found about four pictures and saved them all onto his disk. 
            He then opened them up on front page and inserted them onto his 
            first page. Then we opened up a new page and inserted an old table 
            we had saved a while ago with all of his cheat codes. The table 
            was already saved neatly on Microsoft Word so we just inserted it 
            onto the new sheet. Then we changed the color of the table to make 
            it match the title he gave it. He once again used Word Art and typed 
            Zoo Tycoon above the Cheat Codes Table. I suggested that he include 
            a hyperlink on the page to the Zoo Tycoon website. So we searched 
            the menu to find out how to do it until we finally found it. Then 
            we went to Google again to look for the website. Once we found it 
            I showed Skyler how to copy and paste. We pasted the URL into the 
            hyperlink window and there it was on the screen. Then I suggested 
            he change the color of the Hyperlink to match the rest of the page. 
            So he highlighted it and changed it to red [LT: 11/4/04].</p>

          <p class="text">The Zoo Tycoon activity page (see Figure 2) was a 
            highly engaging design that introduced practices such as searching 
            the web, manipulating and applying information gleaned from this

            create a taskcard that was permeable to the discourses and lifeworlds 
            children bring to literacy events (in this case interests in computer 
            gaming) while engaging them (via intertextual chaining) in literacies 
            related to participation in electronic discourses and problem solving. 
            The anecdote detailing Skyler&#8217;s experience demonstrates the 
            potential exists for creating spaces where learning events are contextualized 
            in ways that are responsive to children&#8217;s goals and popular 
            interests.</p>
          <h4> Holiday Texts and Practices as Gateways: 
            Supporting Visual Literacy </h4>

          <p class="text">Gunter Kress&#8217; writing (Kress, 1999) on multimodality 
            suggests that communication in the information age is inherently 
            a process that involves more than just reading and writing. Students 
            must be fluent in multiple media discourses related to verbal and 
            non-verbal communication. In a similar manner, the new literacies 
            approach emphasizes the importance of students gaining competencies 
            not just in reading text but in applying strategies for reading 
            off-the-screen, understanding images, interpreting colors, and navigating 
            infrastructures for information retrieval (Coiro, 2003; Leu, Kinzer, 
            Coiro, &amp; Cammack, 2004; Sutherland-Smith, 2002). Following this 
            approach for the design of intertextual taskcards, the emphasis 
            was on providing activities in which participants were exposed to 
            a variety of resources in multiple modalities. In the &#8220;Personal 
            Pumpkin&#8221; taskcard (see Figure 4) children interacted with 
            and manipulated images using a popular drawing program, Microsoft 
            Paint. They learned about relationships between symbols and actions 
            on the screen and how images can be modified electronically through 
            the use of color, line, and text to create different visual effects. 
            At the heart of this taskcard was the idea that children should 
            begin early to understand the ways in which images can be modified 
            electronically to convey multiple meanings. Bound up in this goal 
            is the desire for the participants themselves to become versed in 
            the visual literacies that allow individuals to understand graphical 
            iconography and associated electronic tools and applications.</p>

           <h4>Jackie (age 10) &amp; Veronica (age 
            11)</h4>
          <p class="text"> Here, I highlight the two cases of Jackie (age 10) 
            and Veronica (age 11). An undergraduate service learning student, 
            SCS, was able to participate with the girls to complete the &#8220;Personal 
            Pumpkin&#8221; taskcard (see Figure 4): First up were two girls 
            by the names of Jackie (5th grade) and Veronica (6th grade). We 
            had some trouble getting on the webpage given to us at first, but 
            we were up and going with some help from Maria. Once on the webpage, 
            the two girls were to pick their favorite pumpkin out of three and 
            copy + paste it into Paint. On Paint, the girls began to customize 
            their pumpkins by digitally coloring them, and then drawing faces 
            on them. While both girls had no trouble going through the tasks, 
            Jackie was definitely more independent while working. Veronica, 
            on the other hand, asked for my input on whether she should do something 
            or not. She asked about which buttons did which and how she could 
            make better lines. Veronica completed the task card first, possibly 
            because she wasn&#8217;t afraid to ask for help when she needed 
            it. [SCS: 11/1/2005]</p>

                grade)</p></div>
           
          <p class="text">SCS provided the girls with space to work on the task 
            themselves, only helping out when explicitly asked. The discussions 
            that SCS and Veronica had about the icons in Microsoft Paint and 
            how to draw more controlled lines respond directly to the goals 
            I had for the taskcard in that after working through it, Veronica 
            and Jackie had crossed certain boundaries toward understanding how 
            images can be modified and had engaged in some of these practices 
            themselves. In addition to these practices related to visual literacy, 
            they engaged in tasks that required the manipulation of graphical 
            objects and electronic files. For these students close to entering 
            or just entering middle school, moving towards mastery of working 
            with electronic files and graphics will undoubtedly support their 
            ongoing education.</p>
          <h4>Auggie (age 8) and Bran (age 9)</h4>
          <p class="text"> Whereas Jackie and Veronica completed the Personal 
            Pumpkin taskcard with no difficulty, two eight and nine year old 
            boys (working as a pair) found greater challenges in modifying a 
            pumpkin for Halloween. From MAM&#8217;s fieldnotes, there seemed 
            to be excitement about the project because Halloween is such a beloved 
            holiday but the task itself wasn&#8217;t easy. First, the children 
            had to learn what the symbols in Paint mean and then manage to control 
            them. In the fieldnote below MAM describes the children learning 
            this process. In the first trial Auggie selected the pumpkin in 
            the middle of the site and then he began to experiment with the 
            pumpkin by himself in paint bucket. Auggie had trouble like Bran 
            in controlling the paint bucket coloring device in his pumpkin picture. 
            Most of the time Auggie just wanted to colors a certain area of 
            the pumpkin and he would end up painting everything; Bran did the 
            same with his picture and his paint bucket device. In one of the 
            times that Auggie used the paint bucket I had to tell him that in 
            order for him to not spill the paint all over the painting I told 
            him that he need to outline the area that he wanted to the paint 
            to stop flowing to with a different color from the paint. Auggie 
            listened to me and he outlined the teeth of his jack-o&#8217;-lantern 
            so the color orange would not spill into the teeth or the outer 
            area of the pumpkin. [MAM: 10/25/05]</p>
          <p class="text">When MAM provided Auggie and Bran with a solution 
            to the problem of color not staying where they intended, it was 
            really a way of suggesting that the outlines of the image can indeed 
            be modified. Once Auggie realized that he could add not only color, 
            as a child would do to a coloring book, but add the lines to the 
            object as well, he was able to move forward with the activity. Bran, 
            on the other hand, struggled with this concept and attempted to 
            implement a different strategy. With Bran I tried to teach him the 
            same technique but he seems to not understand what I was telling 
            him because he did not does as Auggie. Instead, Bran would get either 
            the pencil or the brush and he would start to color piece by piece 
            the area of his desire instead of just outlining the area with a 
            different color and then spelling paint with the paint bucket. [MAM: 
            10/25/05]</p>
          <p><span class="text">The ability to think strategically about how 
            to use the drawing software, to add components, and edit existing 
            areas with color was challenging for Bran. His alternative solution 
            to the problem of controlling the paint bucket tool is interesting, 
            however, in that Bran was able to find out (in a very short period 
            of time) that the modifiable surface area associated with other 
            tools was precise enough to allow him to have satisfactory enough 
            control over color to meet his goals for the pumpkin (see Figure 
            6). MAM&#8217;s work with Bran and Auggie supported their movement 
            beyond a popular holiday activity for kids, a pumpkin art activity 
            for Halloween, toward new technology-based practices associated

          <p class="text"> The Personal Pumpkin taskcard presented permeability 
            to youth culture and leveraged the excitement children felt surrounding 
            an impending, popular American holiday. Perhaps this motivated children 
            to both begin as well as complete the challenging activity. Furthermore, 
            the excitement about the impending arrival of Halloween is one reason 
            that children such as Bran, who experienced great challenges in 
            completing the taskcard, were still motivated to pursue the activity 
            to its finish. In addition to engagement with Halloween, the children 
            highlighted in the above cases seemed to benefit from the feedback 
            they received from the practicum students that brokered interactions 
            with the taskcards. Boundary crossing toward new practices in the 
            cases of Jackie, Veronica, Auggie, and Bran was supported by patient 
            brokers who ascertained very quickly, in the moment really, what 
            approach to take with the children to introduce new practices while 
            maintaining the children&#8217;s interest.<a name="6"></a></p>
          <h3>Intertextuality and Boundary Objects 
            as Components of Learning Design</h3>
          <p class="text"> Richard Edwards, in a 2005 conference presentation 
            argued that &#8220;identifying and designing boundary objects that 
            enable a change of horizons in learning may therefore enable the 
            border crossing from one domain to another and support learning.&#8221; 
            It is in this same spirit that we ventured to design a set of activities 
            that would act as boundary objects to support children&#8217;s participation 
            in new practices associated with information, visual, and other 
            multiliteracies. Afterschool programs are ideally situated to pave 
            the way toward creating programming inhabited by educative and engaging 
            practices due to their flexibility and, in this case, strong partnerships 
            with other community organizations. One of the greatest challenges 
            involving program design involves devising a way to design activities 
            that are both intellectually enriching and engaging. Activities 
            that leverage children&#8217;s interests and youth cultures represent 
            one approach to developing meaningful and transformative programming 
            for children participating in afterschool programs. As evidenced 
            by the experiences of Skyler, Veronica, Jackie, Auggie, and Bran, 
            when children&#8217;s goals can coexist and enrich those of designers, 
            intervention design for youth participants is at its most relevant.
