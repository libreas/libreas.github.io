    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">Information &amp; Liberation: Writings on the Politics 
              of Information and Librarianship is a collection of essays, interviews 
              and book reviews from the 30+ year career of Shiraz Durrani. Durrani 
              spent the early part of his career at the University of Nairobi 
              Library, until his political writings forced him into exile in Great 
              Britain in September of 1984.</p>
            <p class="text">The collection is divided into four sections including: 
              Society and Information: A South Perspective, The Battle Continues 
              in Colder Climate, Taking a Stand, and Book Reviews.</p>
            <p class="text">The first section Society and Information: A South 
              Perspective includes Durrani&#8217;s writings on libraries, librarianship, 
              politics and the history of Kenya. Durrani tells one story of a 
              university librarian visiting his hometown, where the majority of 
              the populace was coffee farmers. The university library he worked 
              at had a world-renown collection of resources on coffee. Farmers 
              asked him a question: What information did his library have that 
              could explain why they, hardworking coffee farmers, toiled all day 
              to produce a coffee crop that they knew sold for thousands of pounds 
              in Great Britain, yet many were unable to afford to buy their own 
              coffee because they were paid so little for their crop? The librarian 
              had no answer. While his library had information about almost any 
              other aspect of coffee the information held in his library could 
              not answer the social and political question asked by the community 
              members of his hometown. This story really sets the tone of the 
              entire collection of writings of Durrani as he explores the social, 
              political and economic influences surrounding the creation and provision 
              of information services (or lack of), particularly in relation to 
              his experiences in Kenya and Great Britain.</p>
            <p class="text">The Society and Information section is further divided 
              into two subsections. In the first, titled Rocking the Boat, are 
              nine essays that describe the lingering effects of colonialism and 
              neocolonialism had and has on the structure of libraries and library 
              service in Kenya. Politics of Information, Information for Politics 
              &#8211; the second section - describes the creation of underground 
              and alternative literature during and following the Mau Mau movement.</p>
            <p class="text">The Battle Continues in Colder Climates is a collection 
              of essays written following Durrani&#8217;s exile in Great Britain. 
              This section is also divided into subsections. In the first essay, 
              Taking a Stand, Durrani talks about social and political context 
              and action. He calls for active involvement within librarianship. 
              Durrani discusses the active role libraries play in education, both 
              in improving learning through practices such as reflective learning 
              and creating a flexible environment where you can change course 
              content to meet the changing needs of the LIS field. The subsequent 
              collection of essays talks about the successes Durrani has had in 
              turning ideas into action. The three highlighted are the Three Continents 
              Liberation collection, the Black and Minority Ethnic Stock Group 
              in Hackney Libraries, and the Quality Leaders Project &#8211; Youth. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Book Reviews is a collection of six book reviews written 
              by Durrani, which reflect back on topic areas he has focused on 
              during his career. Following the Book Reviews section Durrani ties 
              together the collection under a piece called Organise, Do Not Agonise, 
              which is a saying from the Pan African Movement. In it Durrani asks 
              what, if any positive achievements have been made towards a socially-relevant 
              public library model, as he decries the move towards privatization, 
              the lack of access to information services, the lack of the focus 
              on the social and community sides of libraries. Durrani calls librarians 
              to action by urging librarians, as Mau Mau activists urged the people 
              of Kenya, to &#8220;never be silent.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Durrani is an excellent storyteller. The book is worth 
              reading for the historical accounts of the Mau Mau and the political 
              history of Kenya. The only major weakness of the book is some repetition 
              in the essays as he wrote on some topics in multiple publications 
              or formats. Overall, the book is a great read for those who are 
              interested in a wide range of issues in librarianship from progressive 
              librarianship to information politics, library services to multicultural 
              communities, minorities in librarianship to librarianship in third 
              world countries and to those who are interested in the history of 
              Kenya.</p>
