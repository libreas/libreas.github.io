    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">              <p>I assume that not all LIBREAS readers at first knew what might be 
              meant by the current issue&#8217;s main focus &#8220;library culture&#8221;. 
              In this short report I&#8217;m going to summarize how I found &#8211; 
              while currently studying in Sweden &#8211; my own definition of 
              &#8220;library culture&#8221; and furthermore I will introduce a 
              new library building in the (not so far) north as well: the recently 
              opened <em>V&auml;xj&ouml; universitetsbibliotek</em>[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">].</span></p>

            <p class="text">Since January I&#8217;m an exchange student at <em>V&auml;xj&ouml; 
              universitet</em> while the official opening of the new library building 
              took place on January 16th. As soon as I revealed myself as a &#8220;library 
              person&#8221; during a guided library tour I found myself instantly 
              in happiest accompany. At this time parts of the libraries&#8217; 
              ceiling were still not finished &#8211; so far two quite new experiences 
              merged on the same day for a student used to &#8220;diffidence&#8221; 
              and &#8220;order&#8221; in German university libraries. </p>
            <p class="text">In the following weeks I experienced myself in a quite 
              different way of &#8220;acting in a library&#8221; and considering 
              the libraries&#8217; inner life I noticed different patterns of 
              user and staff behaviour and therefore &#8211; by comparing my experiences 
              in German university libraries and those I made or I am still making 
              in the &#8220;final building phase&#8221; of <em>V&auml;xj&ouml; 
              universitetsbibliotek</em> &#8211; I found out what &#8220;library 
              culture&#8221; means to me. </p>

            <p class="text">From the beginning this university library made me 
              feel of a folksy place where I&#8217;m looking forward to go with 
              joy &#8211; either to work e.g. with classmates in one of the 32 
              various sized group rooms which can be booked online or to meet 
              friends &#8211; aside from studying &#8211; on weekend days for 
              a coffee in libraries&#8217; Caf&eacute; &#8220;Astrakan&#8221;, 
              where you can find most happy and friendly staff imaginable on a 
              Sunday. This experience might not be a special new note for German 
              students in general &#8211; but for me it is!</p>
            <p><span class="text">Besides <em>Uppsala universitetsbibliotek</em>[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">], 
              V<em>&auml;xj&ouml; universitetsbibliotek</em> has the longest opening 
              hours of university libraries in Sweden: On weekdays you can use 
              the library from 8 in the morning till 10 in the evening (Monday 
              &#8211; Thursday) or 6 in the evening (Friday). I&#8217;m especially 
              sold on the opening hours on Saturday (10 AM &#8211; 6 PM) and Sunday 
              (12 AM &#8211; 6 PM). The evening and weekend service is possible 
              by employing Library and Information Science students[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">]</span><span class="text"> 
              which means a somehow limited service (e.g. regarding the reference 
              and other information desk services) for users in the late hours 
              of the day and on weekends. This seems to me to be a bearable &#8220;drawback&#8221; 
              as from my experience most students using the library at these times 
              rather come for simply reading and writing papers. They are escaping 
              to the library from the diversest kinds of distractions they usually 
              have to deal with in the student housings. </span></p>

            <p><span class="text">As a student used to quietness (or even silence) 
              in the Prussian State Library reading rooms and not being allowed 
              to bring any food or drinks (except of course as you may know the 
              SLUB[<a name="f4b" id="f4b"></a></span><a href="#f4" class="back">Fn4</a><span class="text">] 
              in Dresden because of some planning inadvertence of the air conditioning) 
              you might feel queasy in V&auml;xj&ouml;&#8217;s hall at the beginning. 
              Sometimes I even found myself on the verge of doing the &#8220;Psssst&#8221; 
              (for German readers) or the &#8220;Shhhh!&#8221; (for international 
              readers) people back home have to face if they are talking between 
              the stacks and of course I did this turning around with a glare 
              glance to the annoying group of guys dressed like going out on a 
              Friday night on a Monday morning. Fortunately most of the exchange 
              students (including me) hardly understand the Swedish language so 
              you&#8217;re not disturbed by listening to exciting girl talks about 
              all the topics girls usually prefer talk about instead of reading 
              the 1000 pages tome on &#8220;Management Accounting&#8221;. However 
              if you still feel disturbed you can use one of the two silent reading 
              rooms on the 2nd floor.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Students are allowed to take in their bags, backpacks, 
              coats, jackets and anything else one may carry around on a day spend 
              on the campus. Of course the library offers lockers inside the library 
              on the first floor but using it is an option not a command. Sometimes 
              the students even bring coffee and sandwiches to their work places. 
              The library staff first tried to get control of this behaviour, 
              which looks even fearsome to the liberal Swedish librarians, but 
              meanwhile, as the staff and the books are actually not extraordinarily 
              threatened and there are enough possibilities to however keep one&#8217;s 
              privacy and calmness, they stopped worrying and trust in the student&#8217;s 
              sanity and honesty &#8211; and of course also Swedish libraries 
              have a flawless working theft detection system.</p>

            <p><span class="text">All (exchange) students I talked to about the 
              library really like the building, its structure and its holdings 
              with exception of the Swedish classification system[<a name="f5b" id="f5b"></a></span><a href="#f5" class="back">Fn5</a><span class="text">] 
              which is unique also in Scandinavia and enjoys its usage since the 
              early 20th century in both types of libraries &#8211; public and 
              academic. As I heard there are discussions for a long time to change 
              this unsatisfying state but all the talks did not come yet to some 
              solution. However you can find students running around looking for 
              titles they have on their course literature list &#8211; sometimes 
              you even meet one of your classmates and then it&#8217;s a moral 
              question: either tell him or her about your idea where the book 
              might be shelved or hide, go on tiptoeing and try your guess to 
              maybe find the right shelve and be the first to seize the very book 
              you need&#8230;</span></p>
            <p class="text">V&auml;xj&ouml; University got a new library building 
              already in summer 1995. At this time the reopening was a merging 
              of two old library holdings, the old library building and the Special 
              Library for Teacher Education. As I already mentioned there is a 
              small building delay in completion of the current new building: 
              The original plan was to open the ready-made building right after 
              Christmas &#8211; the complete renewal is supposed to be finished 
              in autumn 2006. According to the information given by the library 
              staff there&#8217;ll be no other new building within the next 10 
              years. The current one is reasonable also factoring possible extension 
              needs: In 1999 V&auml;xj&ouml; University became a full university 
              (professorship, doctoral degrees) and had to integrate the holdings 
              of the former separated School of Nursing and Social Work and the 
              School of Police Education.</p>
            <p class="text">The holdings now comprise an amount of 225.000 books, 
              additionally journals, magazines and newspapers in all the languages 
              which are taught at the university. Taken all together the place 
              is supposed to be spacey enough to hold 350.000 books. Working and 
              computer places, study rooms, language and media laboratory and 
              a multimedia room are spread of three library levels.</p>

            <p class="text">What more to say about my almost completely positive 
              experiences?</p>
            <p class="text">A general trend for new buildings is implemented in 
              this new building:
              <em>V&auml;xj&ouml; universitetsbibliotek</em> has no closed stacks. 
              Instead it follows consistently the principle of open access to 
              the holdings. The main holding part (e.g. parliament and government 
              publications) is even placed in the libraries&#8217; centre. More 
              than 90 % of the holdings will be freely accessible when the building 
              is finished in August 2006. </p>
            <p class="text">To be abroad and using a library in a foreign country 
              enables you to understand library culture expressed &#8211; of course 
              &#8211; by the <em>DO</em>s and<em> DONT</em>s, but as well by the 
              way the collections are organized and the building is designed. 
              And most of all you learn about a foreign library culture by experiencing 
              and watching the ordinary people of a country using a library. </p>
            <p><span class="text">There might be a possible hypothesis, that as 
              we shift in certain fields towards a global culture there might 
              be a global library culture evolving too &#8211; something one may 
              think of comparing new library buildings designed by most cosmopolite 
              architects like Rem Koolhaas, Herzog &amp; De Meuron or Sn&oslash;hetta,. 
              But on the other hand you still feel the very difference when you 
              really step in the building and &#8220;live&#8221; the library. 
              So to refine the hypothesis I&#8217;m sure that one will find both 
              in future library culture: the big global element and the fine local 
              specialities. Therefore world stays open for discovery. My advice 
              to all those who are interested in learning more about library culture 
              is a very simple one: Go discover! [<a name="f6b" id="f6b"></a></span><a href="#f6" class="back">Fn6</a><span class="text">]</span></p>
