\textbf{Abstract}: \textit{Queerbrarians} is a German-speaking network of
queer librarians and people working or aiming to work in libraries or
library institutions that was founded in November 2023. Based upon
topics gathered at the first network meeting, this article presents the
motivations for the creation of the network as well as its ideas and
visions of more queer-friendly libraries. \textit{Queerness} is still an
underrepresented topic in libraries in German-speaking countries,
whether it's about patrons, about people working in libraries, or about
the collections or the catalogs. This needs to change. \textit{Queerbrarians} and
this article want to initiate this change, explain why it is important
and valuable, and raise awareness for the queer perspective. It is
almost inevitable that (library) policy considerations will come into
play, because being queer (in libraries) is political.
