    <meta property="dc:description" content="Queerbrarians is a German-speaking network of queer librarians and people working or aiming to work in libraries or library institutions that was founded in November 2023. Based upon topics gathered at the first network meeting, this article presents the motivations for the creation of the network as well as its ideas and visions of more queer-friendly libraries. Queerness is still an underrepresented topic in libraries in German-speaking countries, whether it’s about patrons, about people working in libraries, or about the collections or the catalogs. This needs to change. Queerbrarians and this article want to initiate this change, explain why it is important and valuable, and raise awareness for the queer perspective. It is almost inevitable that (library) policy considerations will come into play, because being queer (in libraries) is political.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/br&gt;Keywords&lt;/br&gt;LGBTQIA+, queer, safe space, diversity, collection, patrons, staff, anti-discrimination, networking"/>

<h3 id="queerness-and-libraries">Queerness and libraries</h3>
<p>Libraries are by the people and for the people and therefore
inevitably reflect human realities, human needs, and human knowledge in
all its facets through their staff, patrons, services, and collections.
This also includes the dimensions of <em>identity</em> and
<em>orientation</em> (Diversity Charter n.d.; Elsheri et al. 2022,
Supplement Figure 2; Timmo D. 2022). In German the term
&#8216;Geschlechtsidentität&#8217; is usually used, which is an insufficient
translation of the more accurate English term <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_identity">gender <em>identity</em></a>
since English allows us to distinguish between sex and gender while
German doesn&#8217;t. According to the <a
href="https://lgbtqia.mywikis.wiki/wiki/Split_Attraction_Model">split-attraction
model</a>, <em>orientation</em> can be defined as romantic and sexual
orientation (Glass 2022). In this article, we combine all of these
aspects under the terms <em>queerness</em> and <em>queer</em> to refer
to people who identify as part of the <a
href="https://lgbtqia.mywikis.wiki/wiki/LGBT">LGBTQIA+</a> community and
their lived realities and needs.</p>
<p>We choose <em>queerness</em> and <em>queer</em> with care and
intention not only for this article, but also for
<em>Queerbrarians,</em> the network of queer people working or aiming to
work in libraries that this article is about. The term <em>queer</em> is
not without controversy and was used as an insult for a long time before
the community reclaimed it as a positive term (Diversity Arts Culture
n.d.). Today, it is sometimes even used to avoid more detailed labels
(Log 2022) or as a synonym for <em>LGBTQIA+</em> (Wright 2024). However,
not all members of the community use it to identify themselves or accept
it as a superordinate label. Others go so far as to explicitly remove
themselves from the community, distancing themselves from it and the
term <em>queer</em>. There are two recent and well-known examples of
this in Germany. Jens Spahn is the former Federal Minister of Health and
member of the Christian Democratic Union of Germany who immortalized
himself with the words &#8220;I&#8217;m not queer, I&#8217;m gay.&#8221;<a href="#fn1"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>
(Achterberg 2023). Alice Weidel is a member of the Bundestag and member
of the Alternative for Germany, a right-wing political party, who
proclaimed &#8220;I&#8217;m not queer, I&#8217;m married to a woman I&#8217;ve known for twenty
years.&#8221;<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> (Achterberg 2023). We have no
intention of contradicting their refusal to use the term <em>queer</em>
for themselves, especially since <em>queer</em> is a political term and
includes the commitment against discrimination and for equal treatment
of all members of the LGBTQIA+ community, to which these people don&#8217;t
commit themselves to. So the fact that we use <em>queer</em> here and in
the network is in itself political.</p>
<p>Some readers might also be irritated by the fact that <em>we</em> is
being used in this article. This is not always common in journal
articles. However, we recognize that our identification as part of the
LGBTQIA+ community has an impact on both the perspectives presented here
and the visibility of queer voices in the library world. In
German-speaking countries, <em>queerness</em> is still an
underrepresented topic in libraries compared to the US (Gerlach 2023).
According to the loop model, there is an interdependency between the
self-image of libraries, library science and practice, and the personal
positioning of librarians (Gerlach 2023). The underrepresentation
mentioned above is therefore also due to the reluctance of queer people
involved in research and practice to take a personal stance and voice
that they are affected themselves. As part of <em>Queerbrarians,</em> we
would like to positively reinforce this interdependence both with the
contribution we make with this article and with the creation of
<em>Queerbrarians.</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> We take our cue from those who came
before us, who paved the way for us and whose openness made others feel
less alone and allowed them to be approached with questions about name
changes, advice on coming out to colleagues and much more (Walters
2023).</p>
<h3 id="queerbrarians">Queerbrarians</h3>
<p>The idea for <em>Queerbrarians</em> was born in a small group during
the planning and submission for a hands-on lab for BiblioCon 2024
(Zeuner et al. 2024).<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a> The session titled &#8220;More Glitter?
How To LGBTQIA+ Safe Space for Libraries&#8221; was planned as an open
discussion for collectively answering the questions of how one can be a
safe person for the LGBTQIA+ community and make the library a safe(r)
space (The Roestone Collective 2014; Minkov 2021). It was noted with
some frustration that the impetus for the discussion and the design of
the hands-on lab was once again in the hands of the community
itself.</p>
<p>If the LGBTQIA+ community wants change, it has to create it itself.
This is a dilemma because overburdening, i.e. overloading members of the
community with additional emotional and actual work around the topic of
<em>queerness</em> (Heinze 2021), is not to be underestimated as an
additional burden to already existing professional activities. This was
also discussed at the first <em>Queerbrarians</em> meeting<em>:</em> The
additional burden of the unintentionally assumed or ascribed role as a
main contact when dealing with <em>queerness</em>, advocating for
visibility and against discrimination or by coming out, mixes with the
need to finally see change.</p>
<p>Roberto wrote about his experiences as a <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Transgender">trans</a> man in his
library in 2011:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Accept that you will be That Transgender Library Staffer for a
while, just because this may be new and unusual at your work, and
because people like to gossip. If you become heavily involved in
workplace activism, you may ultimately become That Angry Transgender
Library Staffer Who Ruins Everything.&#8221; (Roberto 2011, p. 127)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The fact that even in 2024, people with such a role and commitment to
the LGBTQIA+ community are still not always met positively and are
rarely appreciated for their efforts is an additional complication. In
the end, the joke &#8220;Then we might as well set up a network and at least
help each other&#8221; became a reality and <em>Queerbrarians</em> was
founded.</p>
<p>The first meeting with around 60 people took place online on November
21, 2023. This was the overwhelming number of people who responded to
the call via the DACH<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a> Discord server, TikTok and several
German library mailing lists. At this meeting, communication channels
through Discord<a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and email<a href="#fn7"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a>
were established, further meetings were planned and topics, wishes and
concerns were collected. Everything that interests queer library people,
on a large and small scale. In the end, the focus was still on
networking: Who are you? Where do you work? How are you doing there?
What are your pronouns? Is anyone else here <a
href="https://lgbtqia.mywikis.wiki/wiki/Aroace">aroace</a>? No less
central was the establishment of certain rules that apply both to the
virtual meetings<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"

<p>Table 1: The rules of <em>Queerbrarians</em> (as of February 20,
2024).</p>
<p>On Discord there are channels on the topic of
<em>Queerbrarianship</em>, i.e. everything to do with <em>queerness</em>
and libraries, as well as general interests and the further development
of <em>Queerbrarians</em> as a network. The next online meetings are
also announced on the server, as well as via email and on the website (<a
href="https://queerbrarians.de/"
class="uri">https://queerbrarians.de/</a>). The meetings currently
consist of a pre-defined thematic part at the beginning, such as queer
media tips or everyday life as a queer person in your own library, and
an open part for networking and community building at the end. The
current aim is to network and support each other professionally and
thematically, but also just general community building.</p>
<h3 id="queer-topics">Queer topics</h3>
<p>At the first <em>Queerbrarians</em> meeting, a digital pinboard was
used to collect topics and concerns that people would like to discuss.
Through upvotes, all attendees were also able to indicate which topics
interested them as well. In this article, we have compiled the results
and divided them into nine thematic blocks. However individual topics
may fit several different thematic blocks. We also supplement these with
suitable literature and other aspects. It’s important to note that the
topics included here are not an exhaustive list, but rather a reflection
of the concerns that are of particular relevance to
<em>Queerbrarians.</em></p>
<h4 id="queer-togetherness">Queer togetherness</h4>
<p>The topic with the second most upvotes was the stated goal of &#8220;making
the library world more queer-friendly&#8221; (25 upvotes). At this point,
everyone should pause, because this can only be a goal if it is not yet
the case. This realization must be internalized by everyone, especially
the non-queer members of the library community. Only in this way is
change possible. The library world means everything and everyone:
employees, patrons, services, and collections.</p>
<p>Libraries cannot be safe(r) spaces for their patrons if they are not
safe(r) spaces for their employees. The topic &#8220;Queer-hostile workplaces&#8221;
was accompanied by the specific questions &#8220;How do I deal with
queer-hostile colleagues?&#8221; (12 upvotes) and &#8220;[W]hat do I do with
deadnaming in the workplace [&#8230;]?&#8221; (7 upvotes). Deadnaming refers to
the use of the name that a trans or <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Gender_identity#Non-binary">non-binary</a>
person was given at birth, the so-called <a
href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deadname">deadname</a>,
instead of the chosen name (Sinclair-Palm &amp; Chokly 2023). The extent
to which the latter in particular can also put a strain on professional
relationships can be seen from the comments on the question, which ask
about how to deal with incorrect forms of address in business emails and
the limits of cordiality after multiple callouts on the issue. The
question of how long one must remain friendly when boundaries are
crossed repeatedly, such as the use of the correct pronouns and form of
address, is a punch in the gut of all those who belong to one or more
marginalized groups and often experience tone policing.<a href="#fn9"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9" role="doc-noteref"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<p>Another problem is the fact that the deadname cannot be legally
changed so easily and therefore still frequently appears on official
documents such as employment contracts, and affected people are entirely
dependent on the respect and empathy of colleagues and superiors. People
who do not use pronouns, neopronouns,<a href="#fn10"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10" role="doc-noteref"><sup>10</sup></a>
or alternate pronouns and forms of address are also dependent on the
willingness of their colleagues to learn new things and be flexible.
Their only other alternatives are to accept <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Misgendering">misgendering</a> or
to remain in the closet and conform to the ideas of others. This can be
a painful experience and includes, but is not limited to, people who
identify as non-binary, <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Agender">agender</a>, <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Genderqueer">genderqueer</a> or <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Genderfluid">genderfluid</a>
(Thorne et al. 2020; Bradford et al. 2020). Guidelines on
gender-sensitive language that also include gender identities beyond the
binary scheme are a good start (Berufsverband Information Bibliothek
2020; Keite 2024). Unfortunately, integrating and practicing this in
collegial communication is still far from the current reality in some
places.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, <em>Queerbrarians</em> do not think about negative
experiences exclusively, but also aim to address constructive issues
such as how to &#8220;raise colleagues’ awareness - for queer topics,
problems, etc.&#8221; (15 upvotes). This ranges from recognizing these small
forms of everyday discrimination to thinking about non-cis and
non-hetero perspectives and actively advocating for the LGBTQIA+
community. One example of this is &#8220;[u]npleasant Harry Potter discussions
or justifications for why I don&#8217;t want to do HP events&#8221; (8 upvotes). For
all those who don&#8217;t know why queer people have a very difficult to
outright negative relationship with Harry Potter (HP), it&#8217;s time to find
out now by doing your own research (Dias Correia 2023). Researching this
yourself and not expecting to have it explained to you by queer people
on demand is part of the process, the first step to becoming an <a
href="https://lgbtqia.mywikis.wiki/wiki/Ally">Ally</a>, and avoids the
overburdening which has already been mentioned. Creating awareness for
queer issues does not necessarily mean dismissing such an event
entirely, but being sensible of the problem, addressing it openly, not
following up if someone refuses the assignment and not scheduling one of
the openly queer people in the team to host it.</p>
<p>The library community needs to talk about how to create a
queer-friendly environment for staff and patrons. Establishing a &#8220;Code
of Conduct for Events&#8221; (3 upvotes) in our libraries, as is the case with
formats such as Jugend hackt<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref11" role="doc-noteref"><sup>11</sup></a>, can be a start. Codes
of conduct at our conferences and meetings, and in our libraries in
general can also help us all to reduce uncertainty and build trust in
our interactions with one another. In addition, clear position papers
are a tool for libraries to signal to members of the LGBTQIA+ community
that their actions will reflect their words. It needs &#8220;position papers
when things get serious again&#8221; (9 upvotes). The fact that things can get
serious is being felt globally and also in German-speaking countries
(Siggelkow &amp; Reveland 2023). Libraries should therefore be visible
and clear allies for the diversity of all identities and orientations.
Equally, this can be understood to mean that <em>Queerbrarians</em>, as
a community of queer library people, want to speak out through position
papers on queer library issues. Together we can give ourselves a
voice.</p>
<h4 id="queerness-on-site">Queerness on site</h4>
<p>The place in which this togetherness is created is inevitably linked
to the concept of safe(r) spaces. In addition to gender-sensitive
language and queer-friendly interaction, we also need spaces in which
queerness is taken into account. &#8220;Unisex toilets in libraries&#8221; (22
upvotes) remain a current and important issue and have been implemented
too rarely to this date.<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref12" role="doc-noteref"><sup>12</sup></a> Just as we create a
safe(r) space in the communicative space through gender-sensitive
language in which we include all identities, we can and must also do
this in the physical space.</p>
<p>Public libraries in particular create visibility for queer issues by
using <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbtq-pride-flags">pride
flags</a> during Pride Month or permanently to highlight queer
literature. While this can be Rainbow-Washing<a href="#fn13"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref13" role="doc-noteref"><sup>13</sup></a>
(Fille 2022), it still signals that queer people are welcome. The point
of all this is not to be perfect from the start, but to show that the
topic is being reflected upon and that one is open to feedback and
improvement.</p>
<h4 id="queer-it">Queer IT</h4>
<p>While we have the opportunity to correct our words and actions in
direct conversation, such as when misgendering a person, this is not
possible on the website or in registration or similar forms, such as the
registration form for new patrons (Frick &amp; Honold 2022).
Registration forms can usually still be changed easily, in contrast to
the underlying IT systems. Another relevant topic is therefore the
connection between &#8220;queerness and IT&#8221; (12 upvotes).</p>
<p>The majority of processes in libraries are now handled digitally in
predefined workflows. Everything starts with the registration form and
adding new patrons into the library&#8217;s patron administration. When
discussing the topic, a uniform picture emerged: gender is queried at
these points &#8220;because the system asks for it&#8221;. The discussion about
other reasons for this leads to statistics, on the basis of which
literature is purchased and provided. However, this is counteractive to
the desire for libraries not to reproduce outdated gender roles and to
offer readers what they want to read, regardless of their gender
identity (Leyrer 2014).</p>
<p>Adapting or omitting the gender query and changing existing forms and
systems makes them more queer-friendly, because non-binary and trans
people in particular can be put in awkward situations by such queries.
Adjustments of this kind often require major consultations and sometimes
a legal push. However, even the current legally prescribed option in
Germany <em>diverse</em> will not solve this problem, as it is only
aimed at <a href="https://lgbtqia.mywikis.wiki/wiki/Intersex">inter*</a>
people (Antidiskriminierungsstelle des Bundes n.d.). Here too,
<em>Queerbrarians</em> want to constructively discuss how to initiate
change and find solutions, at least in libraries.</p>
<p>In addition to the handling of patron data, there are also
discussions about how and whether established software and processes can
be redesigned when it comes to employee data. Dealing with
&#8220;specifications and [overcoming] difficulties in the implementation of
e.g. email signatures and the like&#8221; (11 upvotes) is an important aspect.
Among other things, this refers to the voluntary inclusion of pronouns
in one&#8217;s own email signature. A step that can theoretically be
implemented quickly and leads to the active inclusion of one&#8217;s own
pronouns being normalized, as it takes the focus off those who do so in
order to avoid being misgendered (Frick &amp; Honold 2022). It also
helps to address others properly and avoids confusion and uncertainty.
Unfortunately, it is not uncommon to hear reports that such information
is not welcome in the signature or even prohibited.</p>
<h4 id="queer-cataloging">Queer cataloging</h4>
<p><em>Queerness</em> must also be considered in the traditional library
field of cataloging. The topic &#8220;Queer Cataloging - which subject
heading(s) to use for queer literature?&#8221; (17 upvotes) not only came up
at the first <em>Queerbrarians</em> meeting, but is a regular topic of
discussion. For example, it has already been discussed whether the
keyword <em>LGBTQIA+</em> is sufficient if one medium is actually
specifically about bisexuality and another about aromanticism, or
whether it is even appropriate to tag media as <em>diverse</em> or
<em>queer</em> (Brown 2020; Drabinski 2013; Wilk &amp; Vincent 2018).
The GND<a href="#fn14" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref14"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>14</sup></a> catalog for subject headings has
some shortcomings when it comes to queer subject headings. Terms such as
<em>cisgender</em> are not listed, unlike <em>transgender. Gender</em>
as the English term to describe gender identity and not sex assigned at
birth has only been implemented recently (Aleksander 2022). The
existence or non-existence and the practice of assigning subject
headings have not only recently come under criticism (Sparber 2016).</p>
<p>How much depth and range we allow in our subject headings and
classifications has an impact both externally and internally. Continuous
reflection, taking into account the perspectives of those affected and
critically questioning and changing previous practices (Hutchinson &amp;
Nakatomi 2023) are a step in the right direction. Homosaurus (<a
href="https://homosaurus.org/" class="uri">https://homosaurus.org/</a>)
and the Queer Metadata Collective (<a
href="https://queermetadatacollective.org/" class="uri">https://queermetadatacollective.org/</a>)
are two examples of such initiatives. This is directly followed by
considerations on &#8220;Naming in the GND&#8221; (8 upvotes). Whether, and if so,
how, a person&#8217;s dead name should be recorded there requires a queer
librarian&#8217;s perspective and a discussion of library ethics on weighing
up the wishes of the person, library practice and the sometimes outdated
rules and regulations written without a queer perspective. Since German
is a very gendered language, job titles are also clearly gendered male
or female. This is particularly problematic if they are used in an
authority record for a non-binary or agender person (Bargmann 2022).</p>
<h4 id="queer-collections">Queer collections</h4>
<p>The collections of libraries reflect the realities of human life,
human needs, and human knowledge in all its facets. Each type of library
does this in its own unique way, and each library is unique in its own
way. From strategic collection management to individual acquisition
decisions, many levels can influence the content represented and the
respective range and depth. External factors are also increasingly
trying to influence library collections. This has been particularly
evident in school libraries in the USA since around 2021, where
so-called book bans have dramatically expanded the scope of censorship
(Orsborn 2022). So far, there is no sign of a decline in the trend; on
the contrary, the number of banned and questioned media continues to
rise. PEN America observes and documents what is happening and notes
that it often affects especially those books that have long had to fight
for a place on the shelf: books by BIPoC (Black, Indigenous, and People
of Color) or members of the LGBTQIA+ community as well as books that
address racism, sexuality, gender, and history regardless of the
author.<a href="#fn15" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref15"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>15</sup></a> Protests by parents or initiatives,
administrative decisions, or political pressure lead to restricted
access to these books or them disappearing from school libraries
altogether. The fact that pressure is also exerted on library
collections in German-speaking countries is nothing new (Laudenbach
2023, Mobile Beratung gegen Rechtsextremismus Berlin 2023).
<em>Queerbrarians</em> would therefore like to address and keep an eye
on the &#8220;banning of queer books in America - (and Germany? Hopefully
not&#8230;)&#8221; (8 upvotes), also to support the libraries abroad.</p>
<p>A general discussion about &#8220;Queer themes/characters in movies,
series, books&#8221; (2 upvotes) can and should also take place. In order to
ensure adequate representation of all gender identities and
orientations, creative collection development is still required in some
cases. For example, self-publishing plays an important role, especially
for underrepresented parts of the LGBTQIA+ community (Kennon 2021).
&#8220;Activist literature and associations&#8221; (2 upvotes) in libraries is also
a topic that should be addressed, as well as the &#8221;<a
href="https://www.youthoutright.org/articles/fetishization-of-the-queer-community">fetishization</a>
of BL/GL (in manga)&#8221; (6 upvotes). BL stands for <em>Boys Love</em> and
GL for <em>Girls Love</em>. It was further explained: &#8220;Choosing
non-fetishizing books is sometimes hard, especially in the mainstream
and also because it often just feels like it&#8217;s the most read material. I
like to try and explain why these books/portrayed relationships are
problematic, but often find it like pushing a boulder up a hill. Do you
have problems like this too?&#8221; <em>Queerbrarians</em> want to and should
be a place for precisely these kinds of questions, which often go
unheard in our own libraries. So it&#8217;s no wonder that &#8220;convincing
colleagues to view [and] expand queer collections&#8221; (7 upvotes) is also a
topic.</p>
<p>Libraries can &#8220;normalize being queer more&#8221; (12 upvotes) through their
collections and thus realize a wish expressed by <em>Queerbrarians.</em>
We do not want to ignore the fact that there are already (albeit not
always librarian) role models for libraries and collections with a queer
focus. Examples include the Queer Library (<a
href="https://queerbib.de/" class="uri">https://queerbib.de/</a>), the
Queerfeminist Library of the General Students’ Committee of the FU
Berlin (<a href="https://astafu.de/bibliothek"
class="uri">https://astafu.de/bibliothek</a>) and the library of the Gay
Museum in Berlin (<a href="https://www.schwulesmuseum.de/bibliothek/"
class="uri">https://www.schwulesmuseum.de/bibliothek/</a>).</p>
<h4 id="access-to-queer-topics">Access to queer topics</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Oftentimes, when an individual is discovering and exploring their
identity, they will search for mirror characters: examples of themselves
in media as a way to understand what it means to identify a particular
way.&#8221; (Allen 2022, p. 3).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Young people in particular therefore associate reading with the
experience of finding themselves in fictional characters and identifying
with them. Accompanying them on their journeys through life, difficult
situations and finding their identity can be an integral part of growing
up and finding one&#8217;s own identity. For queer young people in particular,
studies show &#8220;that LGBTIQ+ identity development processes are their
primary motivators to read&#8221; (Wexelbaum 2019, p. 115). With a greater
range and density of diversity in all media today, it has also become
easier for marginalized groups to find stories that reflect them while
learning to understand their identity, relationships, and the world
around them. However, this is only possible if access to the media is
not restricted or prevented altogether by initiatives such as book
bans.</p>
<p>People who feel they belong to the LGBTQIA+ community experience more
bullying, sexual violence, and mental health problems (Orsborn 2022). It
is therefore all the more important that libraries act as safe(r) public
spaces and give queer people the opportunity to inform themselves,
exchange ideas, and develop in a protected environment (Wright 2024).
This can be essential, especially for people with underrepresented
identities and orientations:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The validation and affirmation of <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Asexual">asexuality</a> as an
orientation and the equitable recognition of the full spectrum of
asexuality are particularly significant for questioning, <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Asexual">ace</a>, and <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Asexual_spectrum">acespec</a>
young readers seeking representation and who might not have encountered
inclusive and respectful stories about their experiences and
identities.&#8221; (Kennon 2021, p. 19; links added by the authors)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the occasion of Christopher Street Day (CSD), the German name for
Pride parades, in the year 2022, Hanover City Library displayed
information flyers on the topic of <a
href="https://trans.fandom.com/wiki/Binding">binding</a> and <a
href="https://trans.fandom.com/wiki/Tucking">tucking</a> (Becker 2023).
The outrage on social media was huge &#8220;and the first reaction was to
simply put the flyers away&#8221;, said Tom Becker, Head of Hanover City
Library (Mobile Beratung gegen Rechtsextremismus 2023, p. 37). Instead,
he sums up: &#8220;We need to become more resilient here - even when it comes
to issues that are not always immediately obvious to our employees.&#8221;
(Mobile Beratung gegen Rechtsextremismus 2023, p. 37) This is how
normalization of access to queer and especially health-related queer
topics works. Libraries can make a significant contribution to the
health education and safety of queer young people, especially by
displaying such flyers. The LGBTQIA+ community has a lot of experience
in organizing and providing health information independently, which grew
out of the sad reality of necessity, and focuses on the collective
knowledge and experiences of its members (Kitzie et al. 2023). Public
library initiatives should therefore work with the community, as Hanover
City Library has done, and not give in to pushbacks.</p>
<p>The event &#8220;Wir lesen euch die Welt, wie sie euch gefällt&#8221;<a
href="#fn16" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref16"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>16</sup></a> organized by Munich City Library in
June 2023 (Heudorfer 2023) also sparked heated discussions and
demonstrations. This was a reading in which a <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/drag-queen">drag
queen</a> and a <a
href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/drag-king">drag
king</a> read from children&#8217;s books and did educational work. The
stories were about overcoming gender stereotypes (Miebach 2023) and
discovering one&#8217;s own independent development (Heizereder 2023). This
reading was not the first of its kind in this library, but it was the
first with election-related and media-effective dissenting voices from
all directions. For example, the CSU (Christian Social Union in Bavaria)
spoke of &#8220;woke early sexualization&#8221; (Miebach 2023) and someone commented
in a <em>letter to the editor</em> for the professional journal of
Berufsverband Information Bibliothek (BuB) that &#8220;libraries should not
overload their programmes with social messages&#8221; (Werner 2024, p. 21).
Ackermann, the director of Munich City Library, emphasized the opposite:
&#8220;We need role models who show us that it is okay to be different&#8221;
(Miebach 2023).</p>
<p>In order to avoid the impression that access to queer topics is only
relevant for public libraries, we would like to highlight that a strong
academic library with extensive and diverse collections, supportive and
helpful staff, and relevant services in cooperation and exchange with
queer networks on campus can greatly contribute to making the campus
more inclusive for students from the LGBTQIA+ community (Clarke 2011,
Wright 2024). In addition, prospective and current librarians also need
access to queer issues. How often these topics arise and are dealt with
in professional and higher education institutions can only be speculated
upon. The choice of queer topics for theses and their publication can be
an indication and at least signals openness in university settings to
the outside world. The same applies to student projects (Berends et al.
2023, 2024). We must not underestimate how important the visibility of
<em>queerness</em> in our professional field can be for those interested
in training and studying. Where we do not see <em>queerness</em>, we
cannot be sure that our <em>queerness</em> is welcome. But
<em>queerness</em> can and should also be a regular topic in training
and studies. Mehra already described possible approaches in 2011. In
addition to formal representation, such as through working groups and
networks, official contacts and workshops to raise awareness can not
only be signals, but can also make our colleagues more sensitive or even
more diverse (Mehra 2011, Table 1).</p>
<h4 id="out-in-work-training-and-study">Out in work, training and
study</h4>
<p>At the first meeting of <em>Queerbrarians,</em> the question of who
is out at work was asked at one point in casual conversation. The result
was very mixed. At this point, it is often argued that cis and hetero
people are not out at work or do not show off their identity and
orientation. However, we live in a cis-, <a
href="https://lgbtqia.fandom.com/wiki/Allo">allo</a>- and heteronormative world. Many
people are apparently not aware that the male perceived colleague who
talks about the weekend with his wife and children does not necessarily
have to be cis and hetero. The male perceived colleague who talks about
the weekend with his husband and children however automatically outs
himself as at least not hetero, although he does nothing different from
the colleague before: talking about his weekend with his family. A
non-binary person who does not want to come out at work is inevitably
misgendered because the prevailing German language still prefers binary
forms, meaning that people primarily use male or female pronouns and
forms to address others and choose which ones to use based on their
perception of the person. If the person also has a chosen name that they
do not use in order to avoid coming out, this results in deadnaming. The
opposite can also be the case: If a non-binary or trans person has
chosen a name that others feel does not match their perceived gender,
this person is often forced to come out, justify their choice of name or
sometimes have unpleasant discussions on the subject. This is
particularly the case if the deadname still appears in official
correspondence, i.e. their own email address or in other places. It
still has to be legally stated everywhere, and administration and IT do
not have to make any adjustments without a legal change.</p>
<p>&#8220;Out at work, yes[,] no? How? Dealing with a lack of understanding
and prejudice&#8221; (14 upvotes) is therefore a key aspect for the well-being
and impartiality of queer people in the workplace (Riggle et al. 2017).
According to a study from 2020, 31% of respondents in Germany are not
open about their <em>queerness</em> in the workplace (Vries et al.
2020). At this point, it must be recognized that there are significant
differences within the LGBTQIA+ community. According to a study
conducted by the British government in 2018, 29% of cis people and 38%
of trans people surveyed were not out to anyone at work (Government
Equalities Office 2018, p. 139 and p. 142). These figures vary greatly
depending on sexual orientation. While only 18% of cis people who
identify as gay or lesbian have not come out to anyone at work, 77% of
cis people who identify as asexual have not. For trans people, these
figures are 27% for trans people who identify as gay or lesbian and 57%
for trans people who identify as asexual. With regard to school,
training, and studies, it can be seen that 10% of both cis and trans
respondents are not out to their classmates or fellow students
(Government Equalities Office 2018, p. 111 and p. 113). The differences
depending on sexual orientation are significantly smaller in these
groups of people, but still exist. There are no studies with this level
of detail in Germany to date.</p>
<p>For those that are out of the closet outside of work, training, or
studies, but not within, find themselves constantly on guard: &#8220;I was
female-identified at work, and some flavor of transgender almost
everywhere else; as I&#8217;ve never really been able to completely separate
my personal and professional lives, this was incredibly difficult to
do.&#8221; (Roberto 2011, p. 124) This costs energy and puts a strain on
mental health.</p>
<p>The desire and need for more visibility and representation must be
met with structural and community changes. This task should not be put
upon the members of the LGBTQIA+ community and certainly not be defined
as their individual responsibility. Being open about one&#8217;s
<em>queerness</em> still has negative consequences. &#8220;One student was
told by a senior lecturer that talking about their asexuality in their
work would limit their career.&#8221; (Benoit &amp; de Santos 2023, p. 13). It
is just as unacceptable that people cannot come out because they fear
repercussions as it is unacceptable to expect people to come out in
order to make <em>queerness</em> more visible and normalize it. We are
talking about very personal and individual choices here, as well as
personal safety and visibility, and all options are legitimate and to be
supported.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a> This also means that no one should
ever out another person.</p>
<p>Libraries need to create an atmosphere in which all members of the
LGBTQIA+ community feel safe enough to freely decide whether or not to
come out. Employees should feel free to bring their authentic selves to
the workplace (Wright 2024). In an ideal world, if we can dream here, no
one would assume anything about another person&#8217;s identity and
orientation, thus no one or everyone would need to <q>come out</q>.
However, our cis- and heteronormative world is not there yet.
<em>Queerbrarians</em> therefore also want to &#8220;normalize being queer
more&#8221; (12 upvotes) by standing together and thus being visible as a
group and not necessarily as individuals.</p>
<h4 id="queer-personnel-development">Queer personnel development</h4>
<p>For those who are out at work, the topic of <em>queerness</em> in
their professional life quickly becomes a matter of the heart. In many
cases, this leads to queer issues and development processes getting
stuck with these people and quickly resulting in overburdening. To
ensure that this does not happen and that the necessary efforts can be
spread across many shoulders, there must be more training opportunities
and educational work on diversity, which includes <em>queerness</em>
among many other topics. The need to talk about &#8220;raise colleagues’
awareness - for queer topics, problems, etc.&#8221; (15 upvotes) reflects this
desire. On the other hand, there is the problem that many employees see
no need for further training in this area (Mefebue 2016). There may be
no malicious intent behind this. &#8220;[the] workplace [is] not queer-hostile
at all, but still very heteronormative&#8221; (19 upvotes). However, ignorance
on the part of non-queer, and in some cases queer, employees means that
issues that need to be addressed are not seen and therefore not
addressed. This is where further training measures and increasing the
attractiveness of libraries as a workplace for queer people can come
in.</p>
<p>In addition to the personal development of employees, change must
also take place at the institutional level if the situation is to change
in the long term:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;We must put our money where our mouths are. We must have leadership
that is willing to engage in brave, difficult conversations that
interrogate the hiring practices of their organizations, as well as how
to retain talented people from underrepresented backgrounds&#8221;
(Stringer-Stanback &amp; Jackson 2023, p. 463).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One person reported that their own library is currently working on
drawing up an &#8220;equality plan&#8221; (6 upvotes). Suggestions and ideas for
queer measures that could be included in this plan were collected on the
Discord server. Such initiatives are one of many cornerstones for the
future-oriented development of libraries and their employees, in which
everyone is considered and involved.</p>
<h4 id="queer-network">Queer network</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;In my working life as a library technician [&#8230;], being trans has
led to hilarious and awkward conversations with colleagues, moments of
genuine connection, and exciting professional development. I&#8217;ve also
felt the impact and toll when transgender issues enter workplace
discussions. My experience of being a trans library technician has been
positive overall, but there is always fear.&#8221; (Nault 2023, p. 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the network, <em>Queerbrarians</em> want to share positive and
negative experiences with each other to support one another in order to
not feel alone. At the same time, this creates connections and synergies
that can create something new, like this article. It is therefore not
surprising that &#8220;Get to know new people&#8221; (28 upvotes) had the most
upvotes. But other networking activities also came up, such as mutual
&#8220;book tips, queer novels, good picture books, gender-sensitive sex
education books etc.&#8221; (11 upvotes), the &#8220;collection of all academic work
from the network [&#8230;] on the topic - e.g. articles, bachelor theses,
dissertations&#8230;&#8221; (6 upvotes) as an open Zotero group and an examination
of differences in the community itself, such as the &#8220;age gap between
different LGBTQIA/<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLINTA*">FLINTA</a><a href="#fn18"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>
generations&#8221; (7 upvotes). These were all ideas that came up at the first
meeting and are currently being addressed by the network. In all of
this, it resonates that change can best be achieved as a team and that
<em>Queerbrarians</em> offers a possible framework for this.</p>
<h3 id="queer-future">Queer future</h3>
<p>The representation of <em>queerness</em> in libraries in
German-speaking countries, whether it’s for patrons, people working in
libraries, in collections or catalogs, is still not sufficient to
support queer people and give them enough security to exist and develop
freely. Based on the experiences and wishes gathered from
<em>Queerbrarians</em>, and the literature cited, we identify the still
insufficient awareness of these issues and queer lived realities in the
library community as one of the main causes. We recognize that for some
it is still unusual to think about non-cis and non-hetero perspectives,
but at the same time queer people always think about cis and hetero
perspectives and cannot be solely responsible for ensuring that queer
realities are represented and supported in library work. This is a joint
mission that must not fail due to a lack of willingness on the part of
non-queer employees and superiors.</p>
<p>Arguments that present the topic as a marginal issue fail to
recognize the library&#8217;s mission and the fact that inclusion is always
important, even if it only affects one person. If libraries want to be
open to all realities of life, queer people must be included, regardless
of whether they are patrons or library staff. <em>Queerness</em> should
not be pushed out of the conversation due to a lack of awareness or by
right-wing movements. Queer people are part of our patrons and part of
the library community. No person working in a library should have to
realize &#8220;how deeply alienating and dehumanizing it is to always be
thinking about how to better serve a community when it&#8217;s politically
toxic to even acknowledge that you and people like you are part of that
community.&#8221; (Baker 2023, p. 158) We would therefore prefer not to argue
with statistics at this point, but since some people need them, we would
like to point out that according to the Ipsos survey on LGBT+ Pride
2023, 13% of the population surveyed in Switzerland and 11% in Germany
identify as part of the LGBTQIA+ community (Ipsos 2023). The fact that
libraries should contribute to the normalization of queer realities
cannot be argued away.</p>
<p><em>Queerbrarians</em> would like to actively work on formulating
what queer-friendly libraries can look like for staff and patrons and
how this can be implemented in library policy, organize training courses
and lectures, and offer open meetings for all library staff and those
working in library institutions, including non-queer people. At the same
time, we recognize our own bias as a predominantly white network — an
overrepresentation that the entire library community must also become
aware of in order to eliminate it. Intersectional perspectives need more
space and visibility. We need more understanding for each other. We need
more knowledge about queer issues. We need more knowledge about romantic
and sexual orientations. &#8220;Wir brauchen mehr Wissen über geschlechtliche
Vielfalt, mehr Informationsmöglichkeiten und eine ehrliche
Auseinandersetzung.&#8221;<a href="#fn19" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref19"
