<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The objectives of modern higher education are mostly considered as a process of teaching scholarly thinking and developing a new level of knowledge for students and postgraduate students. This process is structured in curricular programs, academic research and educational work. Additionally, corporate values, joint projects of various departments, international programs and cooperation are applied to shape the image of a world-class university, i.e., an academic environment, which can be created only via face-to-face communication between scientists and their students, who are developing scholarly traditions together.</p>
<p>A highly topical issue of international scientific library conferences over the last decade is a theme of overall <q>scientometrics</q> and the respective features of library staff&#8217;s new competencies involved with scientific and scholarly journal publishing in Universities.</p>
<p>This article provides an overview of the library&#8217;s contribution to development of editorial and publishing workflows for thirteen new university academic journals. All journals were founded in 2018. The objectives of the article are to explain and frame the mission, tasks, the editorial board working group, and scientometric indicators of those new scientific periodicals of the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a world-class university was not only a leading institution of higher education of the city and country but also a recognized centre for research, well-known scholarly traditions and the domain of experts capable to develop and apply creative ideas, to disseminate scholarly knowledge, to share experience, and to communicate their insights to the scholarly world.</p>
<p>Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts is a relatively young institution of higher education of Ukraine. However, it seeks to obtain the status of a leader among humanities-focused universities in the Ukraine.</p>
<p>A substantial tool to achieve this goal is to widely present the research results, for instance at international conferences or in the form of published scholarly work in collections and journals that are indexed in scientific databases.</p>
<p>The modern university should share the information on new scholarly findings, research results, and a discussion of current developments of arts and culture. The information environment’s transformation changed the formats of production, distribution and use of information, and updated the need for innovative technologies implementation, digital library services, and support services for research provided by the university library. The work with the scientific periodicals of the university, their publishing and editorial support has a top priority. This is emphasized by Suzanne Stapleton’s statement: <q>Academic libraries provide unique perspectives and opportunities in scholarly publishing as a result of their mission to support the research and education agendas of their scholars.</q><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="scientific-journal-publishing-process">Scientific Journal Publishing Process</h3>
<h4 id="stage-1">Stage 1</h4>
<p>At first, the field of scholarly journals for arts and culture in Ukraine was monitored. As a result, the need to create multiple publishing platforms to present results of unique research on audiovisual, choreographic, stage, film and television arts, design, digital communications, etc. was established.</p>
<p>To determine the mission, objectives, readership of potential journals, a list of researchers as potential authors, editorial boards members and reviewers was created. We also considered the journals’ future role to make research more visible through the international scientometrics databases.</p>
<p>When developing the growth and promotion strategy of the publications we focused at providing the following issues journals require:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>international editorial board and authors,</p></li>
<li><p>standardized name in English,</p></li>
<li><p>the ISSN number for print and online publications,</p></li>
<li><p>digital object identifier (DOI),</p></li>
<li><p>high quality content,</p></li>
<li><p>conclusive English texts and a convincing print design,</p></li>
<li><p>an established publication frequency,</p></li>
<li><p>ethical research standards,</p></li>
<li><p>indexing in bibliographic citation databases, journal lists and international search engines.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Taking the above into account, it was decided that the main functions of the newly-established journals should give an idea of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>research trends in Cultural Studies, Art Studies, Social Communications that describe major research findings,</p></li>
<li><p>the level of research integration into the global scholarly community,</p></li>
<li><p>the quality of Ukrainian scientific journals of the related subjects, in comparison with the international ones,</p></li>
<li><p>publication activity of authors of Ukrainian higher educational institutions,</p></li>
<li><p>academic affiliation of scholarly institutions,</p></li>
<li><p>the publications’ ranking according to international citation databases.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="stage-2">Stage 2</h4>
<p>At the second stage, in October 2018, the Scientific Library turned into an active participant of the publishing process and the editorial support for thirteen scientific publications.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the <q>functioning of scholarly publishing is intended to arrange a well-organised connection between the author, the editorial board, the editors, the publisher, and the reader. The effectiveness and success of the journal’s work – its rankings depend on these links&#8217; state of being organised</q><a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. Taking into account the recommendations of the <q>Mohylanskii Protocol</q>, which states that <q>the owner (founder) of the journal and the editorial staff are responsible for the journal as a reliable source of high-quality scientific information on a specific subject</q><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>, there are selected chief editors and members of the editorial boards of scientific journals. The academic prestige of the scientists, their active profiles in Scopus or Web of Science and their articles in these citation indices were taken into consideration.</p>

<h4 id="collaboration-with-editorial-boards">Collaboration with editorial boards</h4>
<p>Collaborating with the editorial boards of the journals between 2018 and 2019, the library undertook the work of obtaining the publications&#8217; ISSN (each for print and online) and ISSN ID certificates in the International Centre (France).</p>
<p>To ease the findability of scholarly publications within a wide range of scientific databases, there is an assignment procedure of DOI for the articles. As of 2020, all articles of periodical publications of the University have a DOI.</p>
<p>Since a key element of a new scientific publication promotion is an informative and well-designed website, which is a journal&#8217;s landmark in e-science space, the IT department of the Scientific Library created and managed the website for each edition using Open Journal Systems (OJS). This includes metadata publishing of journal articles, homepage preparation of the journal issues, integrity ensuring of the database and the landing pages of the scientific journals and regular backup copies.</p>
<p>There is a support service to provide the scientific editorial staff and authors with full tutorial instructions on how to use OJS. It coordinates efforts and unifies the editorial policy of all thirteen journals.</p>
<p>The websites of the journals currently use an Open Journal Systems 2.4.4.1 open-source software package, which serves the processes of management and publication. The package is developed, maintained, and distributed for free by the Public Knowledge Project under the GNU General Public License.<a href="#fn17" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref17" role="doc-noteref"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="stage-3.-indexing-in-international-databases">Stage 3. Indexing in international databases</h4>
<p>In 2018, we began to integrate the new university journals into international databases and reference lists. This process lasted in 2019 as well. Now, all scientific journals and collections of scientific papers are indexed in Crossref cross-publisher reference, in search engines and the databases of BASE, Google Academy, Central and East European Index, WorldCat and in the <q>Scientific Periodicals of Ukraine</q> information resource by the Vernadsky National Library of Ukraine.</p>
<p>All journals are indexed in the international databases of Academic Resource Index (ResearchBib), Index Copernicus Journals Master List<a href="#fn18" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref18" role="doc-noteref"><sup>18</sup></a>, Polska Bibliografia Naukowa (but <q>International Relations: Theory and Practical Aspects</q>).</p>
<p>The journal <q>Ukrainian Information Space</q> is additionally presented on the research portal ResearchGate.</p>
<p>The scientific journals’ websites are placed on the platform of the Ukrainian research and academic network URAN, Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ), one of the most famous search services in the world that provides information to open access materials and indexes both journal and scientific article titles; as well as on Ulrichsweb (Ulrich’s Periodicals Directory), an authoritative international database of periodicals.</p>
<h4 id="future-stages">Future stages</h4>
<p>In the future, to promote the University’s scholarly publications in prestigious databases, lists and search engines, the library will provide training and workshop sessions for authors of articles. The program includes lessons on how to write abstracts, on shifting to e-publishing system-based networking between the author and journal team; to train authors basic principles of using digital article preparation tools offered by Scopus and Web of Science and therefore also to use Mendeley and EndNote.</p>
<p>An important task will be the development of the system into open access defined by the Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI, Budapest Open Access Initiative) via:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>participation of the University’s scientists in international projects of scientific communication,</p></li>
<li><p>registration of the university&#8217;s repository in international search engines,</p></li>
<li><p>listing of all scientific journals of the University in open access directories,</p></li>
<li><p>articles’ compliance with the requirements of scientometrics databases (peer-reviewed, English language, with structured abstract, references and relevant metadata).</p></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
<p>Thus, the Scientific Library of the Kyiv National University of Culture and Arts is completing a complex process of redesigning its role and tasks within the system of scientific communication of the University.</p>
<p>The article has presented the library’s contribution to the editorial and publishing process, as well as to the promotion of thirteen new scientific journals of the University. It has provided a description of the mission, objectives of scientific publications, editorial staff, stages and promotion results within the international databases and lists.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the Scientific Library’s activity will be focused on the development of information-analytical monitoring and bibliometric analysis of communication systems of the University; a design for the representation of scientists’ profiles in the search engines and the international scientometrics databases; facilitating the indexing of scientific journals of the University in Scopus and Web of Science as international databases.</p>
<p>Priorities include the support of e-publishing and the development of individual awareness of lecturers for scholarly research based on international scholarly resources.</p>
<p>Providing the scientific and educational work with information support, the library transforms its role and objectives, reinventing itself from the auxiliary research element to an active participant of scientific and educational work. It boosts the scientific ranking of institutions of higher education and researchers’ brand names as well.</p>
