              Are public libraries facing a new paradigm, concerning library services 
              to people with disabilities? There are at least two different ways 
              of approaching this question. One is whether we may speak of such 
              a thing as a new paradigm within this field, or we are merely facing 
              ordinary changes in an always ongoing evolution of library services. 
              The other way of approaching this question is to ask whether the 
              public libraries actually are facing this paradigm, in the sense 
              of trying to meet the changes with new ways of acting, or are in 
              danger of falling behind, due to not acknowledging the changes that 
              may cause a great impact on the society as a whole.</span></p>
            <p class="text">In this article, I will use the first approach, finding 
              support in ongoing processes and projects in Norway, which of course 
              are closely connected to similar development in Europe. The second 
              approach is not actually a question to be answered at this time, 
              but it is a challenge that should be taken seriously. First, we 
              will have to acknowledge the fact that there is a new point of view 
              on the issue of library services to the disabled, whether this is 
              a new paradigm or not. Then, we will have to raise the awareness 
              on how to approach this &#8211; new ways of thinking demands new 
              ways of action. In this article, I will use a model &#8211; the 
              accessibility triangle &#8211; to present how public libraries may 
              develop their services to disabled persons, within what may be a 
              new paradigm. I will use examples from Norwegian projects and library 
              services, as this is what I know best, but I&#8217;m sure such examples 
              will be found in many other European countries as well. Finally, 
              I will try to draw some conclusions, including some advice on priority 
              issues that ought to be followed, if the libraries are not to fall 
              behind on this important field.<a name="zw1"></a></p>
            <h3>What is a paradigm?</h3>
            <p><span class="text">The online dictionary Merriam-Webster[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">] 
              defines a paradigm[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">]</span><span class="text"> 
              broadly as &#8220;a philosophical or theoretical framework of any 
              kind&#8221;. The philosopher of science Thomas Kuhn referred the 
              word to the set of practices that define a scientific discipline 
              during a particular period of time (Kuhn 1962). The term <em>paradigm 
              shift</em> is often used for a major change in a certain thought-pattern, 
              often a radical change, replacing the former way of thinking or 
              organizing with a radically different way of thinking or organizing. 
              Well-known examples within scientific disciplines are the development 
              of Darwin&#8217;s theory of evolution by natural selection, which 
              overturned special creation as the dominant scientific explanation 
              for the diversity of life; the transition from a Ptolemaic cosmology 
              to a Copernican one &#8211; and the transition between the worldview 
              of Newtonian physics and the Einsteinian relativistic worldview. 
              The term paradigm shift has found use in other contexts as well, 
              extending the value of the term to a limit where it is in danger 
              of loosing some of its value as scientific term.<a name="zw2"></a></span></p>
            <h3>A new paradigm or just a new point of 
              view?</h3>
            <p class="text">When we speak of a new paradigm, this implicates that 
              the theoretical framework we have used as a basis for the library 
              services for the disabled, has made so great a change, that we actually 
              have discarded the framework as such to make room for a new framework. 
              In many ways, the theoretical framework used by public libraries 
              concerning services for the disabled, has been much the same as 
              for the rest of the society. The majority of the population has 
              been the basis when the standards for the basic services has been 
              defined, excluding groups and making it necessary to develop special 
              services for the excluded. We recognize this in the long tradition 
              of having special libraries for the blind and visually impaired, 
              in having home library services for those who are unable to visit 
              the library themselves, and developing special departments in the 
              library for defined user groups, such as the mentally disabled or 
              visually impaired, where they may find books and other material 
              specially selected &#8211; and often specially developed and produced 
              &#8211; for this defined group of patrons.</p>
            <p class="text">This framework is based on the tradition of defining 
              disability as a marked characteristic of the individual itself. 
              It has been closely connected to a medical comprehension, where 
              the disability comes as a consequence of illness, defect or other 
              biological diversion. Within this context, we understand blindness 
              as disability as a biological diversion that makes the individual 
              unable to see, and a wheelchair user is understood as a person that 
              is unable to walk because of for instance a spinal injury. The strategy 
              following this definition will very often be a combination of prevention 
              and treatment, and when these efforts are inadequate, organizing 
              special environments. The efforts are either to change the characteristics 
              of the individual, or rendering assistance through special efforts. 
              Within this framework we may find patronizing attitudes towards 
              &#8220;the disadvantaged&#8221;, seeing them as groups excluded 
              from the majority society, needing special care and support, and 
              becoming users of provided services, rather than active citizens. 
              This is not coherent with the aim of having an inclusive society 
              with full participation from all citizens.</p>
            <p class="text">During the last twenty years, this biological-medical 
              understanding of disability has been heavily challenged. First of 
              all, the society has been criticized for allowing the environment 
              surrounding the disabled to go free. There has been insufficient 
              awareness of the fact that the environment has a major importance 
              for to what degree a person will have to be defined as disabled. 
              A person in a wheel chair is not disabled in an environment with 
              elevators and ramps in stead of (or in addition to) staircases. 
              A deaf person is not disabled in an environment where people use 
              sign language, and a person unable to read will be less disabled 
              in an environment using signs with pictograms in stead of (or in 
              addition to) words. An inaccessible environment is what makes a 
              person disabled.</p>
            <p class="text">The new framework defines disability as a gap between 
              the society&#8217;s demands on the individual, and the individual&#8217;s 
              ability to meet these demands. This framework challenges us to both 
              change the demands of the environment, and strengthen the individual&#8217;s 
              ability to meet these demands, in order to close the gap. This is 
              a new way of thinking, and it may well be called a radically new 
              way of thinking in the context of public library services. We will 
              have to rethink everything we do and how we plan our services in 
              the future, based on this new framework. In this way, we may acknowledge 
              this as a shift of paradigm, forcing us to find new ways of doing 
              things.</p>
            <p class="text">If we do not accept this as a new paradigm, but define 
              the theoretical changes as just an extension of the ongoing development, 
              we may of course go on developing the services rendered to the disabled 
              on this basis, and even probably succeed in giving satisfactory 
              <br>
              services to major groups of the society. Following this path, though, 
              the public libraries will be out of time with the rest of the society, 
              and also loose the possibility of filling the role of being libraries 
              for all.<a name="zw3"></a></p>
            <h3>Universal design</h3>
            <p class="text">A new strategy is being drawn up in Norway to break 
              down the barriers which face the disabled. A special report on this 
              subject &#8220;From user to citizen&#8221; was published in 2002, 
              and has later on been followed by several reports, including a recommendation 
              of establishing a disability discrimination act. In order to achieve 
              the objective of full participation and equality, communities must 
              be fashioned so as to ensure that everybody can participate to the 
              maximum degree on their own terms and in accordance with their own 
              wishes. Accessibility for all is a social right and should in principle 
              be achieved in a non-discriminatory way by an expansion of present 
              availability. Accessibility for all requires universal design.</p>
            <p class="text">Universal design is the shaping of products and environments 
              in such a way that they can be used by everybody as widely as possible 
              and without the need for further adaptation or individual design. 
              The aim is to simplify life for everybody by making products, the 
              means of communication and the environment more usable for a greater 
              number of people at little or no extra cost. The target group for 
              universal design is everybody, regardless of age, size or ability. 
              The threshold is lowered without creating new groups to whom access 
              is denied. A very simple example is the need for good general lighting 
              in a public library. A necessity for those with impaired vision, 
              it is also a benefit to all visitors in finding their way around. 
              Another simple example is eliminating plants causing allergy in 
              the library area and its surroundings, and this way avoid excluding 
              patrons with asthma or allergies. Automatic door openers are often 
              necessary for wheel chair users to enter the library building, but 
              also very convenient for parents with baby prams or strollers, or 
              people who just have trouble opening heavy doors.</p>
            <p class="text">Universal design has become a well-known strategy 
              in public planning the last years, already showing results in accessibility 
              to all within fields like public transport, city planning and design 
              of everyday utensils. Education and training of professionals like 
              architects, designers and city planners has contributed to this 
              development, along with strategic work from governmental bodies 
              like the Norwegian Delta Centre, who has produced guidelines and 
              toolkits for planning and developing. The Delta Centre is the Norwegian 
              centre of competence for participation and accessibility for disabled 
              people. It has among other things been responsible for drawing up 
              accessibility norms for schools, museums and libraries, and also 
              supplies information on making the Internet available to the disabled.<a name="zw4"></a></p>
            <h3>New ways of thinking in the libraries</h3>
            <p class="text">New ways of thinking demand new ways of action in 
              the public libraries. What actions may this be? The Norwegian Delta 
              Centre has drawn up a model that may be useful in defining the libraries&#8217; 
              services to people with disabilities, using universal design as 
              a major strategy in an attempt to narrowing the accessibility gap, 
              but also placing individual services within the model. I will use 
              this model to place both ordinary and special library services within 
              a new framework, and I will use both traditional and new examples 
              from the libraries.</p>

            <p class="erklaerung"><small> The Accessibility triangle. The Norwegian Delta 
              Centre</small><a name="zw5"></a></p>
            <h3> Universal design as a major strategy</h3>
            <p class="text">This model is divided into four sections, where the 
              basic section contains universal design as a major strategy. Shaping 
              of products and environments in such a way that they can be used 
              by everybody as widely as possible and without further adaptation 
              or inclusive design &#8211; the more effort one put into this strategy, 
              the more inclusive will the library services be, altogether. The 
              higher up the division line between this section and the section 
              above comes, the more inclusive is the library to all, and the less 
              effort will have to be made on the higher levels in the model.</p>
            <p><span class="text">The project &#8220;The Accessible Library&#8221; 
              was carried out in Norway from May 2001 to December 2004. It was 
              initiated by the <em>Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority</em>, 
              with the D<em>elta Centre</em> and the <em>Labour Market Authorities</em> 
              as main collaborators on the national level. The aim of the project 
              was to give disabled library users the same access to the library 
              services as other users. The main objectives of this project have 
              therefore been to remove disabling barriers in the physical surroundings 
              and increase accessibility to electronic services in the libraries. 
              The results of the project are presented on the website[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">] 
              of the <em>Norwegian Archive, Library and Museum Authority</em>.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">One of the products of the project is an accessibility 
              guide[<a name="f4b" id="f4b"></a></span><a href="#f4" class="back">Fn4</a><span class="text">] 
              to how to develop accessible libraries, based on universal design. 
              The guide is also supplied with a simple introduction guide. With 
              the accessibility guide one may take a step-by-step tour, starting 
              with the access to the library building from the closest public 
              transport stop, parking availabilities and library entrance area. 
              The guide makes it possible to go through the library premises and 
              check out the accessibility of shelves, signs and other information, 
              lighting, toilets and other facilities, door openers, elevators 
              and caf&eacute; areas &#8211; all based on acknowledged standards 
              and recommendations. The final result of such a checklist walk-through 
              is a very good basis for developing a local action plan for accessibility.</span></p>
            <p class="text">The public libraries must also consider the demand 
              of 24-hour accessibility based on electronic services, the further 
              development of electronic trade and life-long learning through Internet-based 
              teaching. New technology can give older people and the disabled 
              greater possibilities to participate actively in the community, 
              but can also create new barriers. Where there is a disparity between 
              the expectations of the individual and the functional demands of 
              the environment, Information and Communication Technology can create 
              new obstacles instead of improved accessibility. It is therefore 
              vital that everybody should have access to the new technology.</p>
            <p><span class="text">One way of securing accessibility to the library&#8217;s 
              website is to follow the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provided 
              by The Web Accessibility Initiative[<a href="#f5"><a name="f5b" id="f5b"></a></a></span><a href="#f5" class="back">Fn5</a><span class="text">] 
              (WAI). One of the examples WAI gives, is the importance of giving 
              images used on the web a textual description, making it possible 
              to be read also with artificial speech or by Braille list. This 
              way, the information is available also to blind or visually impaired. 
              WAI also accentuates the use of standards like HTML, XHTML and CSS 
              that supports web pages to be read in a uniform way in different 
              browsers. Simple adjustments may simply result in better accessibility 
              to the digital library.<a name="zw6"></a></span></p>
            <h3>Inclusive design</h3>
            <p class="text">The next section of the triangle contains adjustments 
              for specific groups, or inclusive design. To render services to 
              groups of individuals with special needs, the library will have 
              to supply the universally designed library and library services 
              with special equipment and initiatives. Again, the more inclusive 
              these efforts are, the less effort will have to be made on the next 
              level of the triangle.</p>
            <p><span class="text">In the project &#8220;The Accessible Library&#8221; 
              a computer with the necessary technical devises for various user 
              groups and the DAISY[<a name="f6b" id="f6b"></a></span><a href="#f6" class="back">Fn6</a><span class="text">]</span><span class="text"> 
              format for digital talking books were some of the measures taken 
              to include groups with special needs. The Norwegian government has 
              now implemented software providing a speech generator on its information 
              website ODIN[<a name="f7b" id="f7b"></a></span><a href="#f7" class="back">Fn7</a><span class="text">], 
              making all text accessible to blind and visually impaired, and also 
              to the large group of people with dyslexia or other reading difficulties. 
              Clicking the button &#8220;Lytt til teksten&#8221; (listen to the 
              text) opens up the software and large amounts of governmental information 
              is available to all by being read aloud. With 25 million visits 
              a year, this website is probably one of the most important governmental 
              information channels, and should of course be available to all. 
              How many visitors do the libraries&#8217; websites have in a year? 
              How accessible are these websites, or more important: Do we know 
              at all whether they follow the WAI guidelines or not?</span></p>
            <p class="text">Other inclusive efforts to be done may be the production 
              of easy readers, tactile books or audio books &#8211; already well-known 
              to the public libraries, and still necessary to provide for groups 
              who find the traditional collection of the libraries less available. 
              But when more and more text-based information is digitized and made 
              available by speech generator and Braille list, the more resources 
              may be used for production of specially arranged audio books for 
              those who are in need of such, and in such way strengthening this 
              production. One example of this is production of audio versions 
              of textbooks with complicated content, like mathematics, physics 
              and other fields that demands highly qualified readers to interpret 
              illustrations, diagrams and tables.</p>
            <p class="text">Placing aids like audio loops in connection with the 
              library help desk, the lecture room or storyteller&#8217;s room 
              will make people with a hearing aid able to participate in lectures 
              and other events, and communicate with the librarians without trouble 
              &#8211; good examples of inclusive design.<a name="zw7"></a></p>
            <h3>Individual guidance</h3>
            <p class="text">The third section contains the need for individual 
              adjustments and individual guidance. Both universal design and inclusive 
              design aims at making accessibility better for the public at large, 
              and for groups with the same needs. Nevertheless, it will be necessary 
              to meet the individual&#8217;s needs, because people with disabilities 
              are like most people: different. The physical environment and the 
              operations that are necessary to access the services, require sight, 
              hearing, mobility, efficiency abilities etc on different levels. 
              In a working situation, a person with reduced ability in one or 
              more of these fields, may need assistance in adjusting technical 
              equipment and receive guidance in using software etc. in a way that 
              lowers or eliminates the barriers.</p>
            <p class="text">Another important part of the project &#8220;The Accessible 
              Library&#8221; was to establish a new type of jobs, the position 
              of information officer. Knowledge about technical aids and disability 
              was considered to be an important qualification for these positions; 
              and were therefore given to people with impairments. One of their 
              tasks has been to assist library users unfamiliar with the technical 
              devices, and they have also had the task of making the project and 
              the services known among the public. In a public library it will 
              never be sufficient to place advanced technical equipment, or install 
              inclusive software or equipment, and then leave it to the patron 
              to learn how to use these tools by themselves.</p>
            <p class="text">Many libraries offer services to people who have difficulties 
              in partaking in the ordinary library services, or benefit from special 
              organized activities, adjusted to their personal needs. The traditional 
              home service, delivering books to people who are not able to come 
              to the library themselves, is a well-known example.</p>
            <p><span class="text">In Norway, the organization &#8220;Leser s&oslash;ker 
              bok&#8221;&#8220;[<a name="f8b" id="f8b"></a></span><a href="#f8" class="back">Fn8</a><span class="text">] 
              (Reader seeks book) has established what is called &#8220;leseombud&#8221; 
              (reading-ombud) &#8211; an arrangement where people who have problems 
              reading by themselves, receive help from either someone working 
              in the institution where the reader live, a friend or relative, 
              or it may be someone from the public library. The &#8220;leseombud&#8221; 
              cooperates with the local library, which provides both literature 
              and advice on what to read. The &#8220;leseombud&#8221;-arrangement 
              is a network which has as its aim to cover all of Norway, providing 
              reading assistance to people who have difficulties reading, either 
              because of disabilities or illness. The assistance covers both reading 
              and talking about what has been read. &#8220;Leser s&oslash;ker 
              bok&#8221; is an alliance of 20 member organizations, and was established 
              with the aim of providing easy-to-read books for all categories 
              of people with reading problems. The organization receives governmental 
              funding.<a name="zw8"></a></span></p>
            <h3>Personal assistance</h3>
            <p class="text">The top peak of the triangle is meant to secure the 
              need of some few individuals who need personal assistance. Persons 
              with large and complex disabilities often need a personal assistant 
              to partake in different activities. People in unfamiliar situations 
              may also need personal assistance, before they are able to cope 
              with the situation themselves. The difference between individual 
              guidance and personal assistance may be defined by personal assistance 
              being where the patron is unable to do something for himself, but 
              need a second part to actually perform the act on his or her behalf. 
              Guidance, on the other hand, has as an aim to make the patron able 
              to perform the act himself in the future, after being given guidance. 
              A &#8220;leseombud&#8221; reading aloud may be defined as personal 
              assistance, and assisting a multi-disabled patron accompanied by 
              a personal assistance may be defined as individual guidance.</p>
            <p class="text">In a public library, the librarians are familiar with 
              the situation where they meet the personal needs of an individual 
              &#8211; like answering reference questions, giving guidance in how 
              to find one&#8217;s way around the library or locating a book on 
              the shelf. In the framework of the accessibility triangle, the librarians 
              meet a new kind of challenge, where they need to know more about 
              different disabilities, to better understand the needs of the individual. 
              People with difficulties in expressing themselves, for example because 
              of loss of speech after a stroke, people with mental disabilities 
              or lowered movability &#8211; the traditional skills of the librarian 
              must be combined with new knowledge on how to provide services to 
              people with such disabilities.<a name="zw9"></a></p>
            <h3>Challenges</h3>
            <p class="text">The model of the accessibility triangle shows that 
              the library may succeed in supplying better services to all, based 
              on this new framework of thinking. In many ways, we are facing &#8211; 
              or rather are forced to face &#8211; a new paradigm, based on a 
              new definition of disability, with a focus on closing the gap between 
              the society&#8217;s demands on the individual, and the individual&#8217;s 
              ability to meet these demands.</p>
            <p class="text">Perhaps we do not have to discard what has been done 
              so far in giving services to disabled persons, but we should rethink 
              how we approach the issue as a whole. New ways of thinking demands 
              new ways of action. The main challenge in this new scheme is to 
              follow up the concept of universal design as a strategy for giving 
              library services to all. By using acknowledged toolkits and guidelines, 
              both the physical library and the digital library services may be 
              developed to secure accessible services to as many as possible.</p>
            <p class="text">The main challenge, though, lies in the need for raised 
              awareness for the new framework, and for building new skills in 
              the libraries. There is a need for a more user-centered approach, 
              securing services that are both usable and user-friendly. There 
              is a need for knowledge on how to meet the needs of both individuals 
              and defined user groups, knowledge on how to make digital services 
              available to all, and knowledge on how to make use of the concept 
              of universal design.</p>
            <p class="text">The new framework is already there, and the libraries 
              need to face the challenges of giving library services to disabled 
              patrons within the new framework.<a name="zw10" id="zw10"></a></p>
