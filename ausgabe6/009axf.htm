            <p class="text">There are legislative differences between Scotland 
              and the United Kingdom. The United Kingdom Act covers all legislation 
              relevant to England and Wales and to those remaining aspects of 
              the law (e.g. defence, immigration) not delegated to the Scottish 
              Parliament at Holyrood. The Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 
              2002 relates to all specifically Scottish matters and is supplementary 
              to existing U.K. legislation which defines access for the public 
              to information concerning Environmental Issues, Data Protection, 
              Copyright, Designs and Patents. This article will concentrate on 
              the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002.<a name="ank1"></a></p>
            <h3>Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 
              2002</h3>
            <p class="text">The Deputy First Minister for Scotland introduced 
              the Bill for Freedom of Information (Scotland) to the Scottish Parliament 
              in 1999. During his speech he stated: &#8220;Effective freedom of 
              information and openness is as much about culture as it is about 
              legislation.&#8221; </p>
            <p class="text">After numerous consultation expectations were high 
              when the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 came into force 
              in January 2005. These expectations are expressed in the first section 
              of the Act itself under the heading <em>General Entitlement</em>: 
              &#8222;A person who requests information from a Scottish Public 
              Authority which holds it is entitled to receive it.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">During a conference held in 2004 to prepare the Act 
              Tavish Scott, Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Service, stated 
              that the government had &#8222;an overarching commitment to openness 
              and accountability&#8220; and that there was &#8222;continuous and 
              widespread support for Freedom of Information and for its effective 
              delivery&#8221;.</p>
            <p class="text">Openness is a key aim of Freedom of Information (FOI) 
              and Tavish Scott placed it at the heart by stating five principles:</p>
              <ul>
            <li>openness and transparency in government are central 
              to a modern and democratic society</li>
            <p class="text">The Act seemed to be difficult to un
            <li>openness empowers people</li>
            <p class="text">The Act seemed to be difficult to un
            <li>openness improves government</li>
            <p class="text">The Act seemed to be difficult to un
            <li>access to information facilitates public debate </li>
            <p class="text">The Act seemed to be difficult to un
            <li>openness leads to more effective scrutiny</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">The Act seemed to be difficult to understand but however 
              the principles would be simple to put into place. But a caveat was 
              that organisations act like ostriches and put their heads in the 
              sand!</p>
            <p class="text">At the same conference many implications of the Act 
              were discussed including exemptions. Exemptions under the Act enable 
              information to be refused. Exemptions apply when: disclosure would 
              breach the data protection principles; personal Census Information 
              is requested; a deceased person&#8217;s health record is requested.<br>
              A Swedish viewpoint was that even after over 200 years, openness 
              and transparency were still not instinctive. The Swedes were as 
              nervous as anyone about releasing information. &#8220;This is why 
              education and awareness are so important. Every new official needs 
              education. People should take pride in being of service to the public.&#8221; 
              Staff Training, Records Management and Public Awareness were seen 
              as key areas to be addressed by institutions and local authorities. 
              These areas signalled even before the Act was in force are still, 
              2 years later, areas which require attention and on which the successful 
              functioning of the Act depends. Inadequate records management was 
              seen as the main barrier to the Act&#8217;s success. In 2004 it 
              was revealed that only 15 % of the public were aware of the Freedom 
              of Information Act.</p>
            <p class="text">There is extensive training material online in the 
              form of summaries and questionnaires and structured group workshops. 
              This material can be easily downloaded in PDF format. There can 
              be no excuse, if these materials are used, for not understanding 
              the application of the Act. </p>
            <p class="text">The Codes of Practice are important because &#8222;they 
              take the legalism out of the process&#8221; and concentrate on the 
              effective application of Freedom of Information.</p>
            <p class="text">The Charging Structure raises many issues in the way 
              an authority determines charges. Any costs over &pound; 100 should 
              be charged and in Scotland the Act is quite clear &#8211; if the 
              authority estimates that the cost of complying with the request 
              for information will exceed &pound; 600 the authority need not provide 
              it. The main issue was whether the charge should be made for staff 
              time or for services used. The National Library of Scotland developed 
              its own approach described later in this article. In Ireland the 
              reintroduction of charges resulted in a fall in the number of requests. 
              There requests for non-personal information declined by 75 % between 
              2003 and 2004. </p>
            <p class="text">Kevin Dunion, the Scottish Information Commissioner, 
              expressed the view: &#8222;There is no doubt the nature and scale 
              of fees can have a significant impact on the extent to which the 
              primary freedom of information legislation is used and information 
              is disclosed.&#8221; He felt that it was important to realise what 
              are now classified as Freedom of Information requests are not necessarily 
              &#8222;new demands upon an authority&#8221;. The Act may also have 
              prompted investment in specialist staff, staff training or investment 
              in software, which has an organisation-wide benefit in terms of 
              doing business in general &#8211; not just responding to Freedom 
              of Information requests &#8211; through improvements in customer 
              response, document management and information retrieval.&#8221; 
              Further Dunion signalled in his report &#8222;One year on&#8221; 
              the volume of requests for information, requests for review and 
              applications against the decisions of authorities were higher than 
              had been anticipated. This increase is reflected generally in the 
              experience of local authorities. Indications for are the circumstance 
              that authorities are doing well in responding generally within the 
              timescale of 20 days. Public knowledge of the Act has markedly increased 
              with 47 % of the public now aware of it. The Act currently applies 
              to small authorities and organisations including single General 
              Practitioners (Doctors in General Practice). He concluded that there 
              is a need for Performance Indicators, that libraries should do more 
              to fulfil the Freedom of Information requirement of &#8222;Duty 
              to assist applicants&#8221;. Authorities could also often do more 
              to clarify requests from applicants.<a name="ank2"></a></p>
            <h3>Records Management</h3>
            <p class="text">There are 30 pages in the Act&#8217;s Code of Practice 
              Section 61 devoted to Records Management. The Code of Practice refers 
              to records in all formats &#8211; from parchment to paper to digital. 
              This area has required an audit of records management in many authorities 
              and institutions and new systems are either in place or under consideration. 
              <a name="ank3"></a> </p>
            <h3>Local Authorities</h3>
            <p><span class="text">As an example, Stirling Council has a clear 
              policy for the retention of records and this is declared on its 
              website[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">] 
              recording the the deciding factors for each record: </span></p>

              <ul>
            <li>if there is any legislation 
              that says we have to keep records for a certain length of time</li>
             <li>if there is any guidance from professional organisations,</li>
              <li>which records staff need to use in their work</li>
              <li>how much room we have to store records</li>
              <li>whether the records are of historical interest and should be sent 
              to Stirling Council Archive for permanent preservation</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text">Once Stirling Council has determined retention periods 
              which will be added to the website. &#8222;This will help to explain 
              why in some cases when you make a request under the Freedom of Information 
              Act, some information may not be available.&#8221; This is a good 
              example of a proactive policy.<a name="ank4"></a></p>
            <h3>National Library of Scotland</h3>
            <p class="text">Graeme Hawley, Corporate Information Officer of The 
              National Library of Scotland, kindly sent me some of the information 
              he drafted for a submission to the Scottish Information Commissioner&#8217;s 
              consultation on the working of the Act. It represented a basic rethink 
              by the large copyright deposit library of its unique position in 
              Scotland in relation to Freedom of Information. A decision was taken 
              to carry on as if the new Freedom of Information charging structure 
              did not exist and to keep the reprographic charges which were already 
              in place. </p>
            <p class="text">Designation of a request as a Freedom of Information 
              request at the National Library was a vital decision. There were 
              often complex requests about family names which could involve hours 
              of staff time. A typical request might be &#8222;Does my granny&#8217;s 
              name appear in any of the 8.000 manuscripts in (any one of hundreds) 
              collection?&#8221; This large National Library is not looking for 
              ways to get out of cataloguing hitherto uncatalogued collections 
              nor of avoiding helping users with their research or interests. 
              &#8222;Rather it is to say that the Library and its new strategy, 
              are committed to widening access and making its collections available 
              to all through methods such as collection level cataloguing, web-based 
              inventories, digitisation, and working in partnership with other 
              libraries, and had begun this work long before the Freedom of Information 
              (Scotland) Act legislation.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">With hundreds of requests a day, it is difficult to 
              categorise requests. Most of the National Library&#8217;s stock 
              is automatically exempt under section 25, because it is already 
              available to the public. There is a need for the exemption of library 
              stock from the Act and therefore the following recommendation was 
              submitted to the Scottish Information Commissioner: &#8222;The Freedom 
              of Information (Scotland) Act should be revised to exclude information 
              held in the collections of libraries and archives where these collections 
              are already available and accessible to the public.&#8221;<br>
              Questions as to what defines accessibility remain to be answered. 
              For example, is an open collection in Edinburgh to be regarded as 
              accessible to an applicant living in the Shetland Islands?<a name="ank5"></a></p>
            <h3>Freedom of Information and the Disadvantaged</h3>
            <p class="text">There is no specific mention in the UK Act of the 
              rights of disabled people in relation to applying for or receiving 
              the information requested. In comparison, in Scotland, &#8222;Equality 
              in delivering Freedom of Information &#8211; forget no one&#8221; 
              is a slogan spelt out in a workshop from the online Scottish Executive 
              Open Learning Workbook, which does not limit itself to physical 
              disability but concerns itself with: Children, Homeless, Literacy 
              Ability, Disability, Older People, Other Languages and asks students 
              to consider their library&#8217;s policy in relation to these groups 
              of people.</p>

              &#8222;Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 &#8211; A guide 
              for the Information Professional&#8221; highlights differences between 
              the Scottish and UK Acts in the approach to disability. Staff needs 
              to understand that it may not be enough to point to publications 
              on the web. Accessibility issues need to be taken into account, 
              offering alternative formats of publications where possible as standard 
              or on request. The cost of converting the information into an accessible 
              format must be covered by the Public Authority and cannot be passed 
              on to the recipient. Formats mentioned as accessible include print 
              and online versions, audio tape, Large Text Format, Braille/Moon, 
              and alternative languages.</span></p>
            <p class="text">A large authority in the West of Scotland, North Lanarkshire 
              Council, serving a population of nearly 350.000 provides websites 
              with council information in these languages: Cantonese, English, 
              Gaelic (i.e. Scottish Gaelic), Hindi, Punjabi, Urdu. It also states 
              on the web that information about Freedom of Information &#8222;is 
              available in large print, Braille, audiotape or in any other language. 
              Information detailed may be available in a range of formats including 
              hardcopy reports and leaflets, web pages and books, electronic documents 
              (i.e. word processor or spreadsheet), and inspection by appointment&#8221;. 
              Apart from the languages mentioned there are people from Poland 
              and other Eastern European countries living in the area, whose minimal 
              command of English may require considerate treatment.</p>
            <p class="text">The Scottish Act (unlike the UK Act) expressly entitles 
              children to exercise their rights under the Act. This was a late 
              amendment following the wording of the Age of Legal Capacity (Scotland) 
              Act 1991: &#8222;Children can consent to certain activities (e.g. 
              medical treatment/instructing solicitor) if there is sufficient 
              understanding.&#8221; If they are over 12 years of age there is 
              a presumption that this is the case.<a name="ank6"></a></p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p class="text">The greatest contribution of the Freedom of Information 
              (Scotland) Act has been to require a reappraisal of existing methods 
              and resources. It has brought out the value of existing systems 
              and resources but it has also initiated the writing of specifications 
              for records systems in some local authorities.</p>
            <p class="text">It has furthered collaborative working between sectors 
              of library and information professionals and between professions, 
              which can only be beneficial. It has also enabled rethinking of 
              terms like access which now embrace a more proactive approach to 
              the delivery of information.</p>
            <p class="text">We are now at the stage of considering whether we 
              provide too much information! <a name="ank7"></a></p>
