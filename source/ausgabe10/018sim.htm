              <p>The 7th Frankfurt Scientific Symposium &#8211; taking place in the 
              beautiful Westend Campus during the Bookfair &#8211; carried a well 
              chosen title &#8222;Integration of Information Services into the 
              University Infrastructure&#8220;. This motto met exactly the ongoing 
            discussion during the last time due to several reasons: </p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><span class="text">1. It was asked how information services have 
                to be shaped in order to fit into the University Infrastructure. 
                The question between the library as a public place and space, 
                as a living room for the students</span><span>[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span>]</span><span> 
                </span><span class="text"> or as Myong Wilson and Farideh Tehrani 
                were describing as &#8222;Library Messages beyond the border&#8221;<span>[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text"><span>]</span>, 
                giving examples of how the libraries should leave their walls 
                and set off to places where people need the information. &#8211; 
                Information services have to be shaped accordingly posing difficult 
                questions to the strategy, the management and the professionals. 
                </span></p>
              <p class="text">2. How do you define the <em>University Infrastructure</em>? 
                Is there at all a possibility or even the necessity to find an 
                overall definition? Certainly this is not possible and will be 
                one of the most important questions which have to be considered 
                when integrating Information Services into the infrastructure 
                of universities or one university.</p>
              <p class="text">3. The most important problem which will face the 
                university and their information services might stem from their 
                history in Germany. When electronic services and devices were 
                introduced into university libraries in Germany the whole procedure 
                started with the administration. It was very welcome that the 
                administration of lending and borrowing items experienced support 
                by these services, since university libraries in Germany grew 
                considerably in size and number. This first introduction was followed 
                up by co-coperatives in the different states, whereas the university 
                library of Frankfurt was in the forefront of this development, 
                it was also one of the first by introducing and building up one 
                of the first consortia in Germany.</p>
              <p class="text"> 4. But all in all the picture during this time 
                nearly 30 years ago was in so far similar, that libraries did 
                not try to use the electronic advantages in the first place for 
                a better information services and a line was drawn between electronic 
                carriers and printed ones for information which prevented first 
                considerations and experiences with the integration of information 
                services.</p>
              <p class="text"> 5. The Library of the Centre Pompidou, now over 
                30 years ago, was the first library on the European continent 
                which placed the different media according to topic, e.g. it placed 
                videos and slides side on side to the printed item. This was extraordinary 
                and well observed by professionals and all in all a big success 
                for this library which got quite known for setting up an information 
                service which up to this date was not very well shaped in the 
                library world, also not in France, which even developed the historical 
                resources more than in Germany. This might depend on the tradition 
                on library services in Germany and in France likewise, although 
                French libraries had always generally speaking accepted technological 
                advances in a much more positive way than it could usually be 
                observed in Germany. </p>
              <p class="text">6. Although it cannot be easily proven, this has 
                to do with the tradition of German library services &#8211; one 
                shall not overlook this cultural structure of long duration. German 
                Libraries were always strong in collection development which can 
                easily be tied to the academic tradition. The academic world, 
                especially the humanities were also strong in bibliographical 
                instructions which resulted from a very thorough academic education 
                but unfortunately this did not develop into a thorough information 
                services, contrary to the USA where the historical base of the 
                information service, which we admire today, was coming partly 
                from experiences of students which had visited German universities 
                at the end of the 19th century. I may only cite an example from 
                the past from my own experience: Having returned from the United 
                States in the sixties after I have been working there for one 
                year I found out that the Public Library system in Hamburg, one 
                of the biggest public library system in Germany, had got rid of 
                its alphabetical subject catalogue which was such a good base 
                to serve as an electronic tool for information services. As far 
                as structure is concerned such catalogue is not so different to 
                Google and even during these times patrons loved alphabetical 
                subject catalogues. But it has to be confessed that it proved 
                a difficult task to keep and update such catalogue during a time 
                which did not know the electronic devices for such a work let 
                alone the space which had to be provided for such catalogues.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">There might be easily found some more reasons why 
              this seminar was this important. But the question how to shape present 
              information services to fit into the infrastructure of universities 
              presents the base of most professional discussions today. </p>
            <p class="text">The speakers, who came e.g. from the USA (Urbana Champaign, 
              University of Virginia Charlottesville, Library of the State University 
              of Minnesota) and Germany (IKMZ Cottbus, Library TU Munich), Netherlands 
              (Leiden) and Sweden (Lund) were catching the audience by keeping 
              to the topic and not hiding difficulties and obstacles to put this 
              mission into practice. Certainly repositories and their role as 
              a link between academics, students as well professors and researchers 
              took a great deal of the papers presented and discussed. The solutions 
              were very different, the centralised solution of all services was 
              matched by the development of departmental libraries (TFPL &#8220;local 
              librarians begin to plan the transformation of library space&#8220;) 
              which were working together in a network but &#8211; as in former 
              times the institute libraries were on the forefront to the users 
              at the different institutions. </p>
            <p class="text">Commonly all papers stressed the problem universities 
              are facing by the gap between funding which generally goes up the 
              2 % and the real cost which goes up to 4 % by the growing number 
              of students and the growing demands for research, which is becoming 
              increasingly competitive. </p>
            <p class="text">All papers presented the search for a strategy, the 
              identification of key issues, to generate support and the creation 
              of professional space. More and more the search for a one stop shop 
              as well for digital library resources and other information material 
              is looked for. The main mission of supporting research demands a 
              new staff mix and is followed by staff issues. Therefore the agenda 
              for the new future demands reorganisation and reallocation &#8211; 
              which could be generalised in the motto from collection building 
              management to facilitation of research learning and teaching. </p>
            <p class="text">All these considerations, ideas and reports from work 
              done in the university libraries were in a way contradicted by the 
              paper copyright and information within academic institutions (by 
              Ruth Maria Bousonville). Although the US copyright law seems to 
              be more friendly to teaching and research by the fair use and faire 
              dealing the audience was told that up to a percentage of 70% use 
              unfettered content . Librarians in Germany are unhappy about the 
              law and hope for a third basket of the law since teaching, learning 
              and research are dependent on an information infrastructure which 
              has to be build up as seamless information which will determine 
              in a way the quality of information. Researchers are increasingly 
              changing their attitude, the illusion of security is frightening 
              them. Students, teachers and researchers have to trust. The digital 
              library is not a storage but presents today an articulated process 
              and procedures into the flow of information and requires new strategies 
              which could define the library as a diffuse agent within the scholarly 
              community. If you realise the mission of German University Libraries 
              of some ages before of being storage of material the overruling 
              mission today be visualised.</p>
            <p class="text">On the other hand the papers presented at the conference 
              showed that the problems become increasingly common for all the 
              libraries of the world. Therefore such an international conference 
              and discussion has developed from a stage to get to know each other 
              to the stage of discussion common problems. In this context libraries 
              are advancing quickly in international cooperation thus creating 
              the base for better and more efficient collaboration not only in 
              their own field, but in the international world of science and research.            </p>
