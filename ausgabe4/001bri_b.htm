            <h3>The technological impetus for the development of information science</h3>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> Information science did not really 
              take off until the development of computer technology in the 1960s 
              and its increasing use as information technology in the LIS domain. 
              Seen from society's viewpoint, the problem has primarily been how 
              to handle constructively and cheaply the burgeoning production of 
              documents from science, industry and culture. An industrial aim 
              has been to construct a technology to handle increased access to 
              the buying and selling of knowledge; information is becoming a strategic 
              resource on a level with capital, technology and labor.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> The information retrieval industry 
              has become a large-scale industry in the so-called information society. 
              The computer and communication industry has exploded since World 
              War II and is now entering a synthetic phase. Now the computer's 
              various technologies, including calculation technology, telecommunication 
              and language, and more recently its sound and image treatment, are 
              beginning to melt together into a common multimedia interaction 
              technology.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> It seems clear that document retrieval, 
              and therefore registration, indexing and classification, plays an 
              unavoidable and growing role in nearly all types of extensive computer 
              networks and all kinds of knowledge-sharing systems. The larger 
              these systems become, the more central the document-mediating component 
              will become and the graver the problem of indexing and intellectual 
              access.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> As Blair (1990) has pointed out, 
              there is a qualitative shift in the problem of document retrieval 
              once databases exceed 100.000 documents. First, the number of retrieved 
              documents becomes a problem: there are too many documents to sort 
              for relevance. Second, the level of &#8220;noise&#8221; becomes 
              intolerable, especially for full text automatic natural language 
              indexed documents. Third, it becomes nearly impossible to estimate 
              recall: nobody knows what of relevance really exists in a base with 
              15 million documents, such as BIOSIS.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> The problem is, on the one hand, 
              that the user is buried in too many documents of different levels 
              of relevance and knowledge quality, and on the other hand, that 
              the user may miss the most relevant high-quality documents. These 
              are the documents especially suited to the user&#8217;s problems, 
              interests, knowledge background, focus, knowledge level and time 
              for reading. Anyone who has made a subject search on the Internet 
              understands what I am referring to.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> Through the Internet we are improving 
              physical access to electronic documents&#8217; information for growing 
              numbers of people, and we are increasing intellectual access for 
              many newcomers and low-level users of document systems. But high-quality 
              intellectual access is becoming a growing problem for those who 
              need it in their daily work, such as researchers, teachers, journalists 
              and managers. Overload, noise, lack of precision and ignorance of 
              recall are modern problems of document retrieval.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> One way to improve intellectual 
              access is to create interfaces for users with domain knowledge, 
              but without LIS-technical skills. These difficult cognitive and 
              communicative problems are connected to giving access to users who 
              lack domain knowledge and therefore do not know the specialized 
              meaning of the concepts employed, some of which are the same as 
              those used in everyday language.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> There is no doubt that technological 
              development is transforming traditional LIS areas of document retrieval 
              and mediation of knowledge. It is therefore important both theoretically 
              and practically to respond constructively and purposefully to meet 
              this challenge. This requires a scientific basis that encompasses 
              technical, sociological, psychological, and linguistic aspects of 
              the problem of translating peoples&#8217; information needs to system-functional 
              queries.</p>

              <p>From the last twenty years of computer systems development, it is 
              clear that the manipulation of natural language by machines in a 
              social communicative setting with humans is a major theoretical 
              and practical problem. The meaning of language is one of the pivots 
              around which human existence spins. The problem of how precise meanings 
              of signs and words become fixed within a social and cultural practice 
              is enormous from a traditional mechanistic point of view. Attempts 
              to build interdisciplinary information sciences on the basis of 
              the entropic conceptions of information in information theory and 
              thermodynamics have been theoretically and practically unable to 
              fruitfully deal with the problem of the communication of meaning 
              between humans. The functionalist &#8211; or information-processing 
              &#8211; paradigm in cognitive science has the additional difficulty 
              of providing a theoretical background for approaching the problem 
              in IR with multi-faceted meanings of words and sentences. As documents 
              are complex semantic sign and language systems, they are some of 
              the most difficult items to handle in computer systems for retrieval 
              by a broad public. As Blair (1990) argues, users are the only reliable 
              source to judge relevance, and only users can turn information into 
              knowledge.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> No doubt, development of interfaces 
              that are interactive and graphic could improve search quality for 
              low-level users. But something more fundamental in the organization 
              of our scientific understanding of document-mediating systems is 
              at stake. It is a qualitative difference in the way computers and 
              humans deal with the complexity of information. As Luhmann (1995) 
              points out, then humans reduce complexity through meaning. LIS must 
              move from a mechanical information-processing understanding of document 
              retrieval based on only cognitive science&#8217;s information-processing 
              paradigm towards true integration with a more pragmatically semiotic, 
              cybernetic and socio-linguistic theory of understanding in order 
              to improve the design of document-mediating systems. The theoretical 
              foundation of LIS in the IR-area must be replaced by a broader foundation 
              that incorporates the semantic production of meaning. To summarize, 
              LIS has four major problems:</span></p>
           <ol>

           <li>First the lack of a theory of how to design 
                      the best possible document-mediating system for one or more 
                      well-known user groups.</li>
          <li>Second the lack of a theory of how to design interfaces 
                      for non-specialists for huge document bases originally created 
                      for documentalists within certain subject areas or domains, 
                      most often scientific and technical such as chemistry, biology 
                      and medicine.</li>
          <li>Third the lack of full recognition from 
                      computer and software designers and from the arts and sciences 
                      of the interdisciplinary complexity and scientific depth 
                      of the problems of document mediation.</li>
          <li>Fourth the lack of a full theoretical scientific foundation 
                      for the practice of librarianship in the age of the computer. 
                      LIS&#8217; lack of a fully developed theoretical and scientific 
                      self-awareness is a problem for itself, for the recognition 
                      by other scientific subjects and research groups of the 
                      seriousness of the problems it addresses and the depth of 
                      the knowledge it has already acquired through centuries 
                      of practice.</li>

            </ol>
            <p align="left"><span class="text">In my opinion the information-processing 
              paradigm has never been able to describe the central problems of 
              mediating the semantic content of documents from producer to user 
              that documentalists and librarians deal with. It fails in this regard 
              because it does not address the social and phenomenological aspects 
              of cognition (&#8220;becoming informed&#8221; in Buckland&#8217;s 
              1991 terminology), which is the bottom line of the mediation of 
              documents. This leads to serious doubt about the existence of the 
              scientific object in the form of &#8220;objective information processing&#8221;.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> My rejection of the information-processing 
              paradigm of information science is based on views similar to Machlup 
              (1983) and Winograd &amp; Flores' (1987) statements that the original 
              meaning of the word &#8220;information&#8221; is something a person 
              (or a living system) communicates to another person (or living system). 
              The meaning of information can only be understood by considering 
              living beings in a social and historical context. Furthermore, I 
              agree with Machlup when he suggests that one cannot define information 
              as that which reduces uncertainty. The fact is that some kinds of 
              information will make the receiver more uncertain. But if one knows 
              the social context precisely enough to determine the full spectrum 
              of possible outcomes, then one can use a statistical/entropic information 
              concept as part of the description of the characteristics of a message. 
              I further agree with Searle (1986) that the common link between 
              information-processing in humans and machines is not the fact that 
              both follow rules. Machines behave according to causalities, but 
              only conscious beings can willfully choose to follow rules. </span></p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">But since the information concept 
              is now firmly rooted in computer informatics and in the information 
              theories of Shannon and Weaver as well of Winerian cybernetics, 
              another strategy would be to abandon the original human communicative 
              meaning of the concept as Shannon&#8217;s theory of information 
              has never addressed the semantic content of messages. Shannon and 
              Weaver write:</span> </p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="tocsmall">The fundamental problem of 
                  communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly 
                  or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently 
                  the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated 
                  according to some system with certain physical or conceptual 
                  entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant 
                  to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that they 
                  are selected from a set of possible messages. (Shannon and Weaver:

            <p align="left" class="text"> What people and animals treat as &#8220;information&#8221; 
              is quite different from what Wiener&#8217;s theory of information 
              suggests. Stonier therefore makes a sensible discrimination between 
              information and meaning, as information to him is objective structure 
              and organization. This is clear, but we must then realize and acknowledge 
              that the theory has almost nothing to do with semantic aspects of 
              cognition or communication between living systems. As von Foerster 
              concludes:</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p class="tocsmall"> However, when we look more closely at these 
                  theories, it becomes transparently clear that they are not really 
                  concerned with information but rather with signals and the reliable 
                  transmission of signals over unreliable channels (...) (von 
                  Foerster 1980: 20-21)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">Thus, information science in the 
              subject area of living systems and humans will not be able to explain 
              vital aspects of the phenomena of cognition and communication, such 
              as meaning and the constraints of social context. It is also well 
              known that to determine the entropy in a system it is necessary 
              to determine in advance what will qualify as macro states and the 
              probability of every state. There is no room for the completely 
              unexpected, and therefore the real creative complexity of nature 
              and language is lost. Thus this approach has other limits on its 
              own level.</span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In my opinion, knowledge &#8211; or 
              knowing (to underline the process) &#8211; is a far more complicated 
              &#8220;thing&#8221; or process than expected by the &#8220;information-processing 
              paradigm&#8221; described above. According to, for instance, Thomas 
              Kuhn's philosophy of science (1970), nature and human mind are not 
              directly connected. Nature does not speak to us. I would also argue 
              with Maturana and Varela (1980) that nature does not &#8211; in 
              the usual meaning of the word &#8211; transfer information to us 
              through our observation. We participate through science in a socially, 
              biologically and psychologically influenced interpretation of the 
              world.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Warner (1994) points to the problems 
              for LIS if the meaning of words must be partially inferred from 
              a socio-linguistic context. It is clear that simply matching query 
              words to index words, no matter how sophisticated a partial match 
              and ranking algorithm one has, will always have a low precision 
              because the semantics are not equally well-defined.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">In practice, librarians, documentalists 
              and LIS-researchers work every day on the social and practical dynamism 
              of signification and how to relate it to the textual representations 
              in computer systems (not to mention the problems of understanding 
              how the different software system themselves use words). Now through 
              the Internet, corporate Intranets, management information systems, 
              GIS, and file-handling systems, more people are spending more time 
              looking for an exponentially increasing numbers of documents. What 
              LIS needs is an interdisciplinary scientific understanding broad 
              and deep enough to encompass the communicational and organizational 
              aspects of classification and indexing of documents, the computer 
              systems and the producers. Therefore, the theoretical foundation 
              of LIS in the IR-area must be broadened to incorporate the semantic 
              production of meaning in its conception of information science.</span></p>
            <p align="left"> I<span class="text">n his semiotics, Peirce says 
              that the meaning of a word is its use in society (practice of living). 
              This fits well with the language philosophy of the later Wittgenstein 
              who says that words&#8217; meanings are fixed not by definition, 
              but through the &#8220;language game&#8221; they appear in, such 
              as dialogues, persuasions or seductions. This is what Wittgenstein 
              calls &#8220;forms of life,&#8221; in short, the things humans do. 
              Among these are specific kinds of science. Science is a life form 
              and has its own language games, as document searching does by subject.<br>
              The hope of trans-disciplinary theories in information and communication 
              science is that they can deepen our understanding of human to human 
              communication through machine-mediated documents in such a way that 
              we can improve our designs of document-mediating systems. <a name="lis"></a></span></p>
            <h3>LIS: The science of document-mediating 
              systems</h3>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">The subject area of expertise 
              of librarians, archivists and documentalists has always been the 
              storage, indexing, retrieval and mediation of materials carrying 
              data, knowledge, meaning and experience. </span></p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>One can therefore define the objective of 
                      LIS as first and foremost to promote the communication of 
                      desired information from the producer to the user.</li>
              <li>Information can include recorded measurements and observations, 
                      theoretical knowledge, meanings, visions and experiences, 
                      art and fiction.</li>
              <li>I define data as a given input with a structure 
                      that the receiver regards as reliable and usable in a given 
                      situation.</li>
              <li>I define a document as a human work 
                    with communicative intention recorded in a material way. </li>
              </ol>

            <p align="left" class="text">I want to clarify Buckland's view that 
              can be construed considering natural things to be documents in themselves. 
              Something culturally and intentionally communicative such as being 
              put into a classification system must be done to natural things 
              before they becomeS documents. But perhaps we can agree by saying 
              that all things are potential documents, just as everything is potential 
              information. These become documents when they become interesting 
              for members of a communicative knowledge system. But that demands 
              that the object is put into a certain point of view so that it can 
              be viewed from a certain interest, or as Bateson (1973) says:<em> 
              Information is a difference that makes a difference</em>.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">Data becomes information when 
              it is integrated with a given knowledge process and pre-understanding. 
              It only becomes information when it is received and interpreted 
              by a bio-psychological-social knowledge system. The difference between 
              knowledge and information is that information is viewed as a minor 
              part of a knowledge system. But both are dependent on semiotic interpretation 
              if they are to become meaningful. </span></p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">I agree with Salthe in his view 
              that one cannot consider the meaning of information without an interpretation. 
              We could add to Wiener&#8217;s statement that (in itself) &#8216;information 
              is information, neither matter nor energy&#8217;, <em>that information 
              is also not meaning until it has been interpreted by a living system</em>.</span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> LIS is concerned with finding suitable 
              rules for the design of systems and procedures for collecting, organizing, 
              classifying, indexing, storing, retrieving and mediating those materials 
              that support data, knowledge, meaning and experience. As an offshoot 
              of both indexing and communication to users with different requirements, 
              one must study the origins of the various document types, how they 
              are produced, for which users they are created and under which economic 
              and knowledge domain constraints they are produced.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">It has been realized that producers 
              of documents generally have certain consumers in mind, and these 
              consumers are often part of the group of producers themselves. In 
              this way the system is, as seen by a cybernetician, closed in on 
              it self. The LISA bibliographic database, for instance, is a base 
              of information and library science with documents written by librarians 
              and information scientists, to librarians and information scientists, 
              and mediated by librarians and information scientists.<a name="cog"></a></span></p>
            <h3>The cognitive viewpoints opening 
              toward a cybersemiotic concept of information in LIS</h3>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">In agreement with Ingwersen (1992) 
              one can, as an answer to the humanistic-socially-oriented critique, 
              formulate a broader and less objective concept of information than 
              that of the information-processing paradigm. From the cognitive 
              viewpoint, information is seen as the mental phenomena that documents 
              (consisting of signs and text, depending on the state of knowledge 
              of the recipient) can cause. The examination of these &#8220;correct 
              circumstances&#8221; is an important part of information science. 
              In connection with the design of information systems for businesses 
              and institutions, one can now speak of information quality.</span> 
              <span class="text"> The cognitive viewpoint represents three important 
              developments:</span></p>

              <ol>
                <li>Information is understood as potential until 
                      somebody interprets it.</li>
                <li>The objective carrier of information is a sign.</li>
                <li>Interpretation is based on the total semantic 
                      network, horizons, worldviews and experiences of the person 
                      including the emotional and social aspects.. </li>
              </ol>

            <p align="left" class="text"> The aim is for the creation of information 
              in the user&#8217;s mind to be understood as meeting social, cultural 
              or existential needs. This is an important improvement to the intention 
              of cognitive science to create an objective theory about information. 
              One can therefore reformulate information science's aim as follows:</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Library and information science devotes 
              itself primarily to the study of systems and methods for classification, 
              indexing, storing, retrieval, and mediation of documents that can 
              cause the creation of information in the user&#8217;s mind.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The crucial question is that of the 
              interpretation of the document&#8217;s meaning for the individual 
              in a given organizational or institutional connection, and in a 
              given historical situation. Ingwersen (1996) describes the information 
              need as built from a cognitive state (including previous knowledge), 
              a work task, interest and a domain.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Neither information nor quality is constant 
              phenomena; they change over time. Relevance is the keyword here, 
              and relevance is dependent on the meaning we give to things in relation 
              to our preconceptions. It is these social-pragmatic circumstances 
              that form the context for understanding our informational desires 
              and problems. Ingwersen (1996) successfully develops a matrix with 
              four distinct cognitive forms of information needs relevant for 
              determining search behavior and types of polyrepresentation.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> So far, we do not have an explicit theoretical 
              treatment of how varying forms of aboutness come into existence 
              and function in a social context. As information, in this view, 
              develops primarily in an individual mind in front of a document-mediating 
              system, there are no explicit theories about how information develops 
              in social practice. This is where semiotics both as a general and 
              as a social science of meaning generation and interpretation can 
              contribute to the informational view of LIS.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> As Blair (1990) has shown, one of the 
              largest problems of subject searching is that indexer and the searcher 
              do not participate in the same language game! Their work and social 
              environments are different and therefore their use of words will 
              be different. This means that their subject descriptions will be 
              different: they will mean different things with the same words, 
              or they will use different words for the same thing. There is no 
              &#8220;ultimate&#8221; description of a document or of the uses 
              of a subject term. Attempts to make a universal and correct description 
              are pointless because there is no limit to the number of descriptors 
              one could use to characterize a document; semiosis is unlimited 
              (Blair 1990). To limit the spectrum of meanings in a useful way, 
              the indexer must create descriptions in accordance with certain 
              forms of living, such as trading and research, and their language 
              games, also called discourse communities and their discourses.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> From this view, it is possible to point 
              to several systematic reasons why the user does not obtain a satisfactory 
              retrieval result and why this situation is so difficult to improve. 
              Although the large domain-specific databases attempt to make the 
              definition of their classification system (thesauri and controlled 
              keywords, professional indexers) clear and consistent, there is 
              still the human factor of interpretation. The optimum of their actual 
              precision of subject-indexing performance is only 75% consistent 
              between all indexers on a detailed or &#8220;deep&#8221; indexing 
              of a document. The likelihood that a user would use the subject 
              term in the same way as the indexers &#8211; even if the user reads 
              the scope notes carefully &#8211; is even smaller, say 60%. This 
              means that the limits of the sets get very fuzzy. Every time one 
              uses a subject term to describe the documents sought, the chance 
              of locating the right one is 0.75 x 0.60 = 0.45, even when the system 
              was used to the best of the user&#8217;s abilities. When one combines 
              four different subject terms to select specific documents, the chance 
              of selecting correctly is then 0.454 = 0.04 = 4% (see Blair 1990:106 
              for an even more merciless example). This problem preexists before 
              using any mechanical model of partial match using probability, weighted 
              factor ranking, vector space, fuzzy sets or hypertext. These are 
              all based on the ideal of good and consistent indexing and a perfect 
              match with the user&#8217;s application of search terms.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Thus one can only retrieve very small 
              portion of the relevant documents, and a great number of those retrieved 
              will be irrelevant. The more search terms used, the more serious 
              the problem becomes. If one knows the bibliographic base&#8217;s 
              classification system, there are ways to diminish this problem. 
              But most searchers do not, and even for those who do, their efforts 
              diminish the problem, they do not eliminate it. Information is stored 
              in such a way that only specialists combining subject knowledge 
              with technical retrieval knowledge &#8211; investing years of training 
              &#8211; really have a chance to retrieve. The system only produces 
              knowledge with the desired precision and scope for certain groups, 
              and then only to a limited extent. There may be physical access 
              for all, but intellectual access only for highly trained specialists.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The basic problem in LIS is that one 
              must perform an intellectual analysis to determine the content of 
              a document in order to achieve precise and useful indexing.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">Now, does the indexer determine 
              the objective content of the document? Both practice and hermeneutic 
              theory tell us that the content of a document depends on the context 
              in which it is seen, that is to say, what those who read it know 
              and what their interests are. There are at least three ways of determining 
              the content of the document:</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="text"> 1. The content of the document, 
                  as seen from the indexing system (its thesaurus or classification 
                  system). In the best cases this is constructed from a profound 
                  knowledge of the domain of knowledge in question. This is seldom 
                  the case and furthermore, the researcher who wrotes the document 
                  probably did not have the classification system and its concepts 
                  in mind when writing the paper. The writer might invent some 
                  neologisms, a new interdisciplinary subject, or perhaps a whole 
                  paradigm opposed to the paradigm underlying the present classification 
                  system. Finally, the user often does not share the knowledge 
                  background of either the system or the author.</p>
                <p align="justify" class="text">2. The content of the document 
                  as seen from the author&#8217;s viewpoint:<br>
                  One can pick words from the text and the indexer can give a 
                  description with appropriate words. But the determination of 
                  this is an interpretation by the indexer. The main interest 
                  of a document retrieval system is that others who need or require 
                  the document can find it using their own language game, and 
                  this is most likely distinct from those of both the classification 
                  system and the indexer.</p>
                <p class="text"> 3. The content of the document as seen from the 
                  user&#8217;s viewpoint: The problem here is that in most large 
                  document retrieval systems there are so many types of users 
                  that the indexer can only index in relation to the largest and 
                  most formally well-defined knowledge domains.</p>

            <p align="left"> <span class="text">As Blair (1990) suggested, one 
              of the major problems of subject searching is that indexers and 
              searchers do not participate in the same language games. Their work 
              and social environments are different, and therefore their uses 
              of words will be different. The hope of trans-disciplinary theories 
              in information and communication science is that they can deepen 
              our understanding of human to human communication through machine-mediated 
              documents in such a way that we can improve our designs of document-mediating 
              systems. To summarize, our major challenge in LIS now is how to 
              map semantic fields of concepts and their signifying contexts into 
              our systems in ways that move beyond the logical and statistical 
              approaches that until now seemed the only realistic strategies given 
              available technology.</span></p>
