    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p align="justify"> <span class="text">This brief introduction to 
              the &Eacute;cole Nationale des Chartes is not meant as an objective 
              report, but as the personal insight of a third-year student in the 
              &Eacute;cole.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> The &Eacute;cole Nationale 
              des Chartes was founded in 1821 and aims at preparing future curators 
              to their professional life, whether in archives, in libraries or 
              in museums. It is located in the older buildings of the Sorbonne, 
              Paris, which in itself denotes some interest in heritage. The lectures 
              and seminars still take place in a nineteenth-century room, with 
              its old wooden benches and tables, and the entire building is literally 
              packed with books, which conveys a very &#8216;chartiste&#8217; 
              atmosphere. The first thing new students learn is indeed to climb 
              up the high ladders to dig up whatever books they need.<a name="f1b"></a></span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> It is actually a small institution, 
              with only twenty-five new students per year embarking on a four-year 
              course. Applicants must pass the entrance examination after spending 
              at least two years on a &#8216;Classe Pr&eacute;paratoire&#8217; 
              course [</span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text">] 
              </span><span class="text">in Paris, Dijon, Strasbourg, Rennes or 
              Toulouse, where they are specialised in French History. There are 
              two distinct examinations called A and B. Traditionally, most students 
              have entered the &Eacute;cole via the A examination, which mainly 
              consists of a Latin test and of a test in Medieval and Modern History, 
              while the B examination, more recently created, is based on Modern 
              Languages and on Modern and Contemporary History. Only eight candidates 
              per year pass that B examination. In addition, at least one or two 
              foreign students also gain admission each year. The French students 
              have the status of civil servants, which means that they earn a 
              salary and that they are committed to work for the French state 
              for a minimum of ten years.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> Given that the &Eacute;cole 
              aims primarily at training future library and archive curators, 
              the course mainly deals with using documentary sources, especially 
              ancient ones. As an old clich&eacute; goes, &#8216;chartistes&#8217; 
              are supposedly very fond of all kinds of dusty, decaying and unreadable 
              documents. In their first year, they are all taught Palaeography, 
              Romanic Philology, Latin and Medieval Latin, History of the Book, 
              Archive Sciences, Art History and Archaeology. Afterwards they are 
              free to choose their subjects according to both their career plans 
              and their personal interests. In their last year at the &Eacute;cole, 
              they also take part in a seminar to reflect upon the notion of heritage. 
              Though many students attend the art history classes, only a few 
              of them will become museum curators, owing to the very small number 
              of posts available. A minority of students finally turn to school 
              teaching or to university lecturing, particularly in History, Art 
              History, French or Classics. </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">While studying at the &Eacute;cole, 
              &#8216;chartistes&#8217; write a PhD in History. This so-called 
              &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole des Chartes&#8217; is in 
              fact very specific and does not really compare with either a British 
              PhD or a French doctorate thesis. Students choose their own subjects, 
              and their work ranges from a purely historical analysis to the edition 
              of an ancient text. Companion courses to the thesis cover bibliography 
              skills, computer sciences, statistics and cartography. Students 
              are also free to use some hundred thousand volumes available to 
              them from the School Library. The Library exists since the 1840s 
              and specialises in Medieval History, bibliography, French History 
              sources, and Latin and Romanic philology. Unfortunately, Contemporary 
              History resources are thin on the ground. Yet this library still 
              has a great advantage: being devoted to a very specific membership, 
              it can afford to have most of the holdings in free access, available 
              for browsing. Given also that you can take many books out, the library 
              plays a key-role for the students. Of course, permit is required 
              to consult some rarer documents, such as the ancient books and engravings 
              which are used for the History of the Book seminars.</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> Students begin to work on their 
              &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217; during their second 
              year and they must complete it within two years. They receive advice 
              and guidance from two supervisors: one from the &Eacute;cole and 
              one from University. Another link between the two institutions is 
              that students usually prepare a Master at University, as part of 
              their &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217;. Once finished 
              with their &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217;, more 
              and more students continue at University where they turn it into 
              a proper Doctorate. Difficult to give you an idea of how long the 
              &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217; is, since it can 
              be anything from four hundred pages (140.000 words) right up to 
              a thousand pages (350.000 words) &#8211; for the bravest and the 
              chattiest! </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">To me, the main advantage of 
              this experience is that it allows people who will mainly work in 
              archives and libraries to explore the other side of the mirror, 
              in other words to be in the same position as the researchers they 
              will have to help in their professional life. It helps seeing both 
              points of view and reducing any lack of understanding which may 
              exist between researchers and curators. </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">I also find it interesting that 
              the same basic knowledge should be taught to future archivists and 
              future librarians alike (not to mention future researchers, who 
              get well prepared for juggling with historical sources). As for 
              librarians, the &#8216;chartistes&#8217; are obviously more able 
              to manipulate ancient documents relevant to their fields, though 
              at the end of the day, they may work in any type of library. Moreover, 
              there is a point to a firmly interdisciplinary course, especially 
              since historians, art historians, archaeologists, and museum-, archives- 
              and library-curators tend to work in very partitioned worlds in 
              France. Though I appreciate that each of those careers are highly 
              specialised, more cooperation between them would be greatly beneficial. 
              </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">Nevertheless, as you may have 
              noticed, the &Eacute;cole only provides a very theoretical background. 
              That is why, after the &Eacute;cole, the students have to take yet 
              more entrance examinations. The two main ones are the Institut National 
              du Patrimoine (INP) examination, which targets both archivists and 
              museum curators, and the &Eacute;cole Nationale Sup&eacute;rieure 
              des Sciences de l&#8217;Information et des Biblioth&egrave;ques 
              (ENSSIB), which is meant for library curators. Those two schools 
              deal with all practical, concrete aspects of the careers they pave 
              the way for. So even though the &Eacute;cole does deliver a diploma, 
              it does not allow students to go straight into jobs at the end of 
              their cursus (except for research jobs at the Centre National de 
              la Recherche Scientifique, the CNRS). The &Eacute;cole is now trying 
              to find solutions to the problem posed by its overwhelmingly theoretical 
              course contents. Despite being notoriously backward-looking, the 
              institution is now undergoing changes which are called for by the 
              current context. </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">In the face of the problem, 
              some pragmatic steps have long been set up in order to give students 
              the opportunity to meet curators and to give them an idea of their 
              future job. Visits of various institutions are organised, among 
              which the public library of Versailles, the duc d&#8217;Aumale&#8217;s 
              library in Chantilly, and the departmental archives of the Manche, 
              in Normandy. Other projects are the study of ancient books in famous 
              Parisian bookshops (such as B&eacute;r&egrave;s, which is now closing 
              down), and the study of rare and ancient books in the reserve collections 
              of important libraries (like the Biblioth&egrave;que Sainte-Genevi&egrave;ve, 
              the Biblioth&egrave;que de l&#8217;Arsenal and the reserve of the 
              National Library). In their third year, students also catalogue 
              ancient books in cooperation with libraries. At the end of their 
              first year, students undergo a training course in small groups: 
              they stay one week in a French town, where they spend their time 
              in the archives, the library and the museum. Such steps provide 
              positive effects, though their scope was found to remain too narrow. 
              </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">As a consequence, more recent 
              steps have been taken. Students are encouraged to follow parallel 
              training courses at the end of their first year. They are advised 
              to spend at least one month in an institution of their choice, in 
              order to explore the concrete realities of the job. Then at the 
              end of their second year, they have the opportunity to spend another 
              month abroad in a European institution, for which they get grants. 
              A partnership between the &Eacute;cole and Russian libraries has 
              been set up for two years, and Russian librarians come and spend 
              a few months at the &Eacute;cole. Those training courses represent 
              a very positive progress, even if they will not completely solve 
              the problem of being too theoretical. The very short timing, however, 
              has to be taken into account: because of writing the &#8216;th&egrave;se 
              d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217;, the students cannot afford to spend 
              much longer in libraries or on training courses while at the &Eacute;cole.<a name="f2b"></a></span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> More positive changes have 
              occurred. The European licence [</span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span class="text">]</span><span class="text">-master-doctorate 
              thesis means that students from University can be welcomed at the 
              &Eacute;cole. Most of them study History, Art History, French or 
              Classics, and their courses at the &Eacute;cole now count towards 
              their university cursus. And in the future, thanks to a global national 
              reform entailing a semester-based organization, &#8216;chartistes&#8217; 
              will be able to study abroad as part of the ERASMUS scheme. This 
              will enable students to choose &#8216;th&egrave;se d&#8217;&Eacute;cole&#8217; 
              subjects requiring archives located in a foreign country, which 
              will be much more convenient and probably enlarge the scope of their 
              projects. <a name="f3b"></a></span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">Unfortunately, some problems 
              remain unsolved to this day, and all changes have not brought positive 
              effects to the &Eacute;cole. The French state is currently trying 
              to limit the number of civil servants curators for the sake of economy. 
              Increasing pressure is put on those posts, leading to a major argument 
              over the ease with which &#8216;chartistes&#8217; take the entrance 
              examinations to the INP and the ENSSIB. In fact, even if all &#8216;chartistes&#8217; 
              do not succeed in passing those examinations, they doubtless are 
              more likely to pass than others: &#8216;chartistes&#8217; who want 
              to become librarians do not have to prepare for the written parts 
              of the examination and only need to work for the oral test; moreover, 
              a number of posts is booked for them. As for future archivists, 
              they enjoy even more advantages: the &Eacute;cole stands for the 
              only direct route to the job of archives curator [</span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text">]</span><span class="text">, 
              so that their monopoly gets more and more criticized. The controversy 
              should be taken seriously, and might question the future of the 
              &Eacute;cole. In the short term, though, &#8216;chartistes&#8217; 
              are not an endangered species, and the museum specimens are still 
              to be found behind the desk not the showcase!</span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text"> As a conclusion, I hope that 
              this brief, general survey contributes to give some idea of the 
              &Eacute;cole, which is not the only way to become a curator in France, 
              though it certainly is the oldest and the most particular one. </span></p>
