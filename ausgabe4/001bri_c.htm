             <h3>Various types and definitions of information</h3>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">There are various other different 
              aspects of information and meaning that are significant. In his 
              analysis, Buckland (1991: 6) usefully distinguishes the difference 
              between: </span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">a) Personal knowledge (private, 
              mental),<br>
              b) The process of knowing or becoming informed, <br>
              c) Objective/intersubjective materially registered knowledge (documents) 
              and <br>
              d) Information/data processing, the mechanical manipulation of signals 
              and symbols. <a name="img3"></a></span></p>
            <p align="justify"><span class="text">He summarizes this in Figure 
              3:</p>

                  which will not be our strategy. [</span><a href="#content" class="back">back</a><span class="erklaerung">]

            <p align="left">I <span class="text">will use similar distinctions:
              1. phenomenological knowledge, 2. documents, 3. cognition and 4. 
              information processing. But not use information as an overall concept, 
              but rather as a dualistic concept based on differences that has 
              to be interpreted to generate meaning for an observer.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> In my evaluation, the cognitive 
              viewpoint represents an important first step away from the mechanistic 
              information-processing paradigm in cognitive science as a foundation 
              for LIS. It is a step towards a theory that encompasses the social 
              and linguistic complexity of LIS and IR in a more realistic way. 
              Librarians and LIS researchers know this complexity empirically 
              from their own experience, and so far research has modeled different 
              limited aspects of it. But we still have difficulties with the construction 
              of a comprehensive theoretical framework, which can improve consistency 
              in our use of scientific concepts within LIS, guide our research 
              and development of research methods, and finally, provide the background 
              for the interpretation of empirical research. The cognitive viewpoint 
              has made some important changes in the basic view of the communication 
              process in LIS and IR that are compatible with modern semiotics 
              and pragmatic language philosophy. Within the cognitive viewpoint 
              there has been empirical research and developed theory about the 
              situation of the individual user with an information need confronting 
              an information system. But further aspects must be developed for 
              the theory to be comprehensive and broaden it into a general framework 
              for information science.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> As in Machlup&#8217;s theory of 
              information, in the cognitive viewpoint the focus is on the individual. 
              Machlup denies that social systems can communicate. Ingwersen (1996) 
              is open to the study of the influence of knowledge domains on concept 
              formation and interpretation as launched internationally by Hj&oslash;rland 
              &amp; Albrechtsen (1995) in the domain analytic paradigm. They give 
              theoretical reasons why classification and indexing should be directed 
              toward the ways signification is created in discourse communities 
              related to different knowledge domains, especially within the different 
              fields of science.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> This insight leads to the need 
              for a general semiotic framework of communication and sign processing. 
              We need to open LIS to the results and constructive thinking of 
              a more general theory of how signs &#8211; such as words and symbols 
              &#8211; acquire their meaning through communication, be it oral 
              or written (Warner 1990). Semiotics should encompass not only social 
              and cultural communication, but also should be able to address natural 
              phenomena such as the communication of biological systems. It should 
              have categories for technical information processing. At the same 
              time, this trans-disciplinary theory should distinguish between 
              physical, biological, mental-psychological and social-linguistic 
              levels, and not reduce them to the same process of information. 
              So far there is not much evidence that a profound and practical 
              understanding of information and communication can be found by reducing 
              them to the mechanical manipulation of symbols. A theoretical understanding 
              of the interpretation of signs by biological-social systems is necessary 
              for speaking about communication of information.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> This leads us to the third requirement: 
              a theory of the cognition and communication of signification should 
              be able to encompass different types of systems. Neither the objective 
              syntactic approach of the information-processing paradigm, nor the 
              personal phenomenological approach of Machlup can deliver a framework 
              encompassing communication processes in social, biological and technical 
              systems. We cannot ignore that cybernetic information science that 
              is behind and embedded in the computer is now a general tool for 
              document mediating systems. As Buckland (1991) points out, we must 
              draw on systems theory and cybernetics, and, with Warner and Blair, 
              I add semiotics.<a name="use"></a></span></p>
            <h3>The usefulness of Peirce&#8217;s 
              approach in LIS</h3>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">This is all very abstract. Let 
              us therefore consider its usefulness in the Library and information 
              science area to demonstrate what this conceptualization does to 
              help us in one sort of practice; one we have already introduced. 
              The interpreting process according to the semiotic view is unfinishable, 
              just as is scientific knowledge that seeks &#8220;the truth&#8221;. 
              Peirce calls this unlimited semiosis. Signs are woven into meanings, 
              which are linked to societal-cultural communicative praxis and history. 
              Lexical denotations do not define the meaning of signs; these are 
              defined by their use in social life, such as in a language game. 
              Blair points out the significance for LIS for this fundamental understanding 
              of the processes of signification: </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify"> <span class="tocsmall">In terms of inquiry, 
                  the notion of unlimited Semiosis has important consequences 
                  for the representation of texts. First of all, there can be 
                  no necessary and sufficient (i.e., complete) representation 
                  of a text (other than the entire text itself and even this may 
                  not be sufficient for retrieval purposes, (...)). Secondly, 
                  the standard to be used to judge the usefulness of a particular 
                  textual description is not that of &#8220;correctness,&#8221; 
                  but one of &#8220;appropriateness.&#8221; In other words, a 
                  textual description is neither correct nor incorrect, but, rather, 
                  more or less appropriate for a given task and situation. (Blair 
                  1990: 137-138)</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="text">The compatibility between Blair&#8217;s 
              &#8220;appropriateness&#8221; and Glasersfeld&#8217;s &#8220;viability&#8221; 
              is obvious. Glasersfeld also thinks in terms of different tasks 
              within society, which relates to the &#8220;work task/interest&#8221; 
              of Ingwersen (1996) and the domains of Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen 
              (1995). The meaning of words is created through language's cultural-historical 
              background and the social communicative praxis between people, who 
              have their own subjective historical access to the meanings of a 
              sign. People are never in complete agreement about all the meanings 
              of a word or concept. But through the development of customs they 
              may reach an agreement on its meaning within situations experienced 
              jointly. This is significant in various domains of science and the 
              humanities, where long traditions have fixed the meaning of specific 
              concepts. The practice of law has also developed its own special 
              terminology. The pragmatic-semiotic approach is important because 
              it is these connections that constitute the individual&#8217;s understanding 
              and ability to:</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p><span class="text">1. Decipher the document&#8217;s signs.<br>
                  2. Decipher the document as a sign in itself. <br>
                  3. To evaluate the relation and value of the sign within the 
                  actual situation.</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left"><span class="text">As Blair points out, one must base 
              the organization of document-mediating systems on conventional uses 
              of concepts:</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p><span class="tocsmall">In short, Peirce is pointing out that 
                  there can never be a necessary and sufficient explanation or 
                  description of the meaning of a sign/expression. In the sense 
                  of meaning which we have developed here, this means that there 
                  can never be a complete description of the kinds of allowable 
                  uses that can be made of a given expression. But this is not 
                  a despairing observation; in fact, it puts our analysis into 
                  a more thoughtful context. Instead of concerning ourselves with 
                  definitive uses of expressions, we can recognize this endless 
                  regression of meaning/signification and concentrate on elucidating 
                  conventional uses of expressions, realizing that new and creative 
                  uses of these expressions are inevitable &#8230;. What is important, 
                  then, is not just the uses of an expression, but the conventional

            <p align="left"><span class="text">Peirce is both a phenomenalist 
              and a realist. For Peirce, the meaning of a sign can be boiled down 
              to the habits to which it gives rise and the influence it has on 
              the world (including the inner biological and mental states of the 
              interpretant) now and in the future. His theoretical rhetoric is 
              the science of how signs become effective in a constantly changing 
              historical and social context where there are no final referents. 
              Blair (1990) draws the following conclusions for the understanding 
              of indexing in LIS from this semiotic view of meaning:</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p><span class="tocsmall">In the first place, there is an unlimited 
                  number of unique documents which a single subject description 
                  can be used to represent. In the second place, there are an 
                  unlimited number of subject descriptions that reasonably could 
                  be applied to any one document. Traditional indexing theory, 
                  though aware of the ambiguity and inconsistency in the assignment 
                  of subject descriptions, has never demonstrated a full awareness 
                  of the magnitude of this problem, preferring to think of such 
                  difficulties as temporary aberrations rather than the first 
                  waves of a rising tide of difficulties (...). (Blair 1990: 169)</span><span class="text">

            <p align="left"><span class="text">This provides a theoretical understanding 
              of the enormous practical problems that have faced classificators 
              and indexers for centuries. The ongoing evolution of signification 
              poses a major difficulty for all document-mediating systems. Every 
              classification system implicitly attempts to define specific meanings 
              of words, and after a few years this becomes a problem for all dynamic 
              knowledge systems. It is an essential for LIS to be able to change 
              classification and indexing systems quickly to follow changes in 
              the meanings of language, while at the same time keeping track of 
              previous records. Since these changes are semantic and related to 
              social practice, we do not yet have a mechanical way to accomplish 
              this. Currently, any document database using words as classification 
              and index terms should have its documents re-indexed every five 
              years to keep in accordance with the present meaning of the words. 
              Furthermore, it would be ideal to have specific classifications 
              and indexing for different user groups with different interpretations 
              of keywords, to account for their different types of educations, 
              sciences, and practices.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text">Some would argue that Peirce&#8217;s 
              semiotics do not tell us much about texts and language. But as Blair 
              claims, Peirce is in general agreement with Wittgenstein, who in 
              his &#8220;Philosophical Investigations&#8221; (1958) Sect. 43 says 
              that: &quot;For a <em>large</em> class of cases &#8211; though not 
              for all &#8211; in which we employ the word &#8221;meaning&#8221;, 
              it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the 
              language. Suggests that the meaning of a word is equivalent to its 
              use within a specific &#8220;language game&#8221; within a &#8220;life 
              form&#8221; (<em>Lebensform</em>) as mentioned earlier? Language-games, 
              forms of life and rule-following are shaping the meaning of any 
              word. It is a matter of what we do with our language in social practice. 
              It is not something hidden inside anyone&#8217;s mind or brain. 
              Words, gestures, expressions come alive only within a language game, 
              a culture, a form of life. If a picture for example means something 
              then its meaning is not an objective property of the picture in 
              the way that its size and shape are; it means something to somebody. 
              The same goes for any mental picture. Mankind lives in cultural 
              communities or forms of life, which are self-sustaining, self-legitimating, 
              logically and normatively final. Actually Wittgenstein also mentioned 
              being a Lion as a life form, when he explained that we could not 
              understand it if it could talk.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text">Blair&#8217;s work attempts to 
              integrate the crucial insights from Peirce&#8217;s semiotics with 
              Wittgenstein's pragmatic language philosophy in order to re-examine 
              the problems of IR and LIS in a new light. Blair argues that the 
              semantic socio-pragmatic basis for meaning is a fundamental aspect 
              of Peirce&#8217;s &#8220;unlimited semiosis.&#8221; Blair demonstrates 
              how essential it is for LIS to realize that to comprehend a concept&#8217;s 
              meaning, indexers and classifiers must understand its use for a 
              given producer, in a given specific knowledge domain, and for a 
              given user group. I suggest that this fundamental semiotic and socio-linguistic 
              knowledge is the theoretical foundation behind the domain analysis 
              of Hj&oslash;rland and Albrechtsen (1995) as well as the cognitive 
              viewpoint that employs concepts of &#8220;about-ness&#8221;.</span></p>
            <p align="left"><span class="text"> But understanding the language 
              game of the knowledge domain from which a document originates is 
              not enough. One must also understand the language game of which 
              the IR-process is a part. One aspect of this is the knowledge domain 
              from which the user comes, but just as important are the intentions 
              and social expectations users have of the system, as determined 
              by their own understandings of their tasks. Blair writes:</span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify"><span class="text"> </span><span class="tocsmall">Various 
                  kinds of activities (Forms of Life) can serve as a context for 
                  the retrieval of subject material. Activities such as defending 
                  or prosecuting a lawsuit, patent searching, conducting research, 
                  making a business decision, etc., all may make use of subject 
                  searching at various times and at various levels of intensity. 
                  The nature of the activity being pursued influences subject 
                  searching in two important ways: In the first place, the language 
                  of the activity, its jargon or cant, will determine which words 
                  will be used to describe and ask for subjects. Some activities 
                  have or use information that breaks down readily into subject 
                  areas, such as academic disciplines (especially the &#8220;harder&#8221; 
                  or more formal ones), while others have and use information 
                  that may not be as readily classifiable (think of activities 
                  that deal with new or innovative products or processes, such 
                  as new marketing, engineering or medical techniques, to name 
                  only a few). The other way in which the nature of an activity 
                  can influence retrieval is in determining the level of exhaustivity 
                  needed for satisfactory retrieval. Patent searching, the defense 
                  of a lawsuit, or searching to support original research all 
                  demand that the information retrieval which supports their activity 
                  be as exhaustive as possible. The activities of &#8220;Just 
                  keeping informed&#8221;, browsing, or introducing oneself to 
                  a new field require less exhaustive searches to be conducted. 
                  (Blair 1990: 158)</span></p>

            <p align="left"><span class="text">As we shall see, even more language 
              games are actually in play in the IR-process, as is already understood

              of &#8220;about-ness&#8221; (Ingwersen 1992). In my opinion, the 
              concept of a language game provides both a theoretical and pragmatic 
              framework for understanding about-ness and provides an important 
              link between this idea and broader social-pragmatic theories of

                  and searched for in the language game of the search language. 
                  If the user has someone to help, then this problem will be further

              <span class="text">The skill of the librarian to mediate between 
              different language games in document mediation is a complicated 
              one that becomes increasingly complex every year. Because the number 
              of documents and users grows exponentially, economic considerations 
              force us to seek automated solutions to these problems. It is very 
              important to research how to achieve the most productive integration 
              between machine and human skills. But the economic necessity of 
              using machines should not obscure the fact that the central challenges 
              facing LIS are often the interface between the socio-pragmatic linguistic 
              and the logic or algorithmic processing of sign vehicles that computers 
              perform.</span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Indexing is central for information 
              storage and retrieval. The indexer allows a descriptor to represent 
              something else &#8211; such as a document &#8211; so that it can 
              be found by means of something else, on the basis that these entities 
              in some respect share the same content/idea. This description parallels 
              the description of the sign.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> It is necessary to identify the sign 
              relations between descriptors and documents to understand these 
              relations as signs, and to recognize that the signs can alter sign 
              categories &#8211; in other words, the sign alters nature according 
              to the person who interprets it. The relation between the descriptor 
              and the document is essential for understanding and recognizing 
              what happens during indexing and retrieval. Through a semiotic discussion 
              of this relationship is it possible to describe the nature of descriptors 
              from the users&#8217; level of knowledge. We have included the user 
              in the descriptor-document relation. However, we have seen that 
              there are also other semiotic webs involved in the user-descriptor-document 
              relationship &#8211; namely the semiotic webs of the indexers and 
              the semiotic webs of the authors. If information retrieval is to 
              be successful, these semiotic webs must approximate each other.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> I am sympathetic to van Rijsbergen and 
              other colleagues&#8217; attempts to resolve the difficulties of 
              computer document mediation by creating new kinds of logics, although 
              I would still argue that the core relationship for mediating documents 
              is semantic, and that semantic relationships are not built primarily 
              on logic, but rather on motivated relations influencing the intentionality 
              of conscious awareness. These are established through the evolution 
              of living systems (ethology) and through the history of life forms 
              and language games in societies. They are created as structural 
              couplings of significance within a semiotic web (such as Peirce&#8217;s 
              triadic semiotics), established through the living system&#8217;s 
              relationships to nature and other bodies within social systems.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The computer has seduced us into framing 
              our questions within its algorithms. It seems we have forgotten 
              to maintain and develop a theoretical framework for our subject 
              area that allows us to see beyond the horizon of the computer and 
              to make demands of those researchers developing computer systems. 
              If we do not provide a metatheoretical description of our own area, 
              it becomes difficult for others, such as computer scientists and 
              software developers, to understand that they have entered a new 
              territory with different rules. We must provide a strong theoretical 
              understanding of the difference between physical and intellectual 
              access. The growth of the Internet makes this knowledge more important 
              every day.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> One should start with a pragmatic analysis 
              of the informal communication system. This is the most powerful 
              semiotic force to which any information system must adapt, and as 
              Lakoff (1987) demonstrates, its semantic patterns are neither logical 
              nor random &#8211; they are motivated. This accords with the cybernetic 
              view of information as generated within an autopoietic system, and 
              language communication as occurring within generalized media. Motivation 
              stems from the type of media, but the actual language game chosen 
              within the media determines a large part of the motivation for the 
              relationship between concepts. If there is no proper feedback between 
              producers, indexers, and users, the system will not produce information 
              &#8211; it will not fulfill our expectations. We all participate 
              in several language games simultaneously, but professionally we 
              must consciously select and maintain one at a time whenever possible. 
              As information is only potential when there is no interpretant, 
              the only information in our systems is relevant retrieved documents. 
              This further supports much of Bates&#8217; work on the sense-making 
              approach (1989).</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The pragmatic approach generally means, 
              as previously mentioned, that a philosophy of science analysis of 
              the domains/subject area/work tasks and paradigms in science, as 
              well as a knowledge sociological analysis of communication patterns 
              such as the discourse analysis of written text, is important for 
              describing the decisive context of the use of our systems. They 
              must be adjusted to our context, work task, and the budget allotted 
              the research. These methods should be supplemented by questionnaires, 
              association tests, and registration methods. The expenses of this 
              research are a challenge, but the willingness to pay for basic research 
              is connected to the users&#8217; awareness of how central insights 
              into the socio-pragmatic linguistic framework are to the performance 
              of the designed systems. We are moving past the phase of unreflective 
              fascination with electronic systems and into a more realistic evaluation 
              of how they can help us mediate communications between humans via 
              documents. If one considers Ingwersen&#8217;s (1992) analysis of 
              what a mediator system must do to function properly, one realizes 
              we cannot expect machines to solve the complexity of human communication 
              without human mediation.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">This knowledge also tells us that 
              there is limited utility to the non-professional users of the enormous 
              scientific and technical bibliographic bases where many millions 
              of documents have been categorized into Boolean systems by trained 
              documentalists. Here, the users are the documentalists themselves, 
              and the trained researchers from part of the domain, search bases 
              that have not been made generally accessible through the Internet. 
              New digital libraries based on the same outdated principles and 
              word-to-word matches are constantly being established also in the 
              industry. A bibliographic system such as BIOSIS, based on the present 
              theory, will only truly function within a community of biologists. 
              This means that both the producers and the users must be biologists 
              &#8211; and so must the indexers. Even then there will be difficulties, 
              because the producers and the users of the bibliographic database 
              will also be researchers. This is a life form that follows a language 
              game different from that of indexers. But if indexers maintain contact 
              with both users and producers, solicit their feedback, attend their 
              conferences, and investigate their ways of utilizing literature 
              and scientific concepts, the system will holistically produce information. 
              One should not understand document-mediating systems as merely information 
              keepers and deliverers. They are information producers, once we 
              include interactions with users as part of the system!</span></p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">In the enormous domain-specific 
              systems, we have to accept a centrally organized knowledge system. 
              We can simplify through menu-driven systems only at the cost of 
              speed and precision. We can help users understand what kind of system 
              they are working with by providing thesauri to consult and work 
              from directly. We can remind them to consider specific vital details 
              by asking them to answer questions as part of an obligatory procedure. 
              All this is now done in new types of interfaces. Blair (1990) suggests 
              offering users the opportunity to view extracts of papers that the 
              use of specific index terms will access, and what other users have 
              accessed using similar searches. Any technique that helps users 
              understand the language game they are participating in, how it is 
              structured, and how words work within it is fruitful when combined 
              with opportunities to navigate, explore, and learn the system by 
              oneself.</span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In these cases we cannot bring the system 
              to the user, so we must bring the user to the system. This will 
              not happen if we simply install a natural language processing interface 
              that pretend to the users that this system will do most of the thinking 
              for them. We should clarify that these systems only help users who 
              do not have the time or ability for other types of search process, 
              because users will have practically no control over the processes 
              by which papers are accessed. This might nevertheless be useful 
              if these users want only a few documents on a subject of interest. 
              The same can be said for the automatic indexing of full-text documents 
              (Blair 1990), unless it is in a sharply delineated and rigidly formalized 
              subject area. Automated procedures give users little insight into 
              what occurs within a system. Users have very little opportunity 
              to control the language game they are participating in. This does 
              not even broach the issues that arise when index terms from one 
              language game are used to seek documents in another.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">The problem of intellectual access 
              cannot be resolved by intelligent user-interfaces in the pre-existing 
              Boolean system. Nor will the addition of automated indexing, including 
              natural or knowledge-domain specific language manipulation, or including 
              full text systems (Blair 1990). Undoubtedly each is useful within 
              limited contexts. In currently existing, large scientific bibliographic 
              databases, considerable efforts have been made to deliver interfaces 
              that obligate users to pay attention how the base is structured 
              and remember its most relevant aspects. By reading manuals, one 
              can acquire a simplified theoretical impression of how the controlled 
              index terms are used. Blair (1990) suggests that users should have 
              the opportunity to view samples of papers that are retrieved using 
              a search term, so that users can gain experience about how words 
              function within the language game of the classification system, 
              and through this learn their meanings. The BIOSIS Previews manual, 
              for example, gives theoretical examples of this kind. It is also 
              important to allow as much opportunity for exploring as possible.</span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> When we contemplate designing a new 
              document-mediating system from the bottom up, the suggestion is 
              to specialize document-mediating systems for specific knowledge 
              domains, knowledge levels, and points of interest, and to consider 
              the size of the system. This means constructing bases entirely from 
              users&#8217; needs and conceptual worlds. We must supplement current 
              methods with pragmatic analysis of discourse communities with various 
              knowledge domains, both scientific and non-scientific.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Most current bibliographic databases 
              contain documents produced by different paradigms, specialties, 
              and subject areas, all of which have different language games even 
              when they share a vocabulary. I only need to mention how data-engineers, 
              cognitive psychologists, and information scientists use the concept 
              of information, or how Newtonian physics and Einstein&#8217;s general 
              relativity use the concept of space. Each subject area with interest 
              in the documents of a database should have these documents indexed 
              according to their own language game in order to make precise searches 
              possible. As is already acknowledged in BIOSIS, for example, chemists, 
              physicians, and biologists each have specific terms for chemicals, 
              illnesses, and classifications of plants and animals that are respected 
              by the BIOSIS indexing procedure. But under current indexes, as 
              a biologist I must use chemical notation searching for a chemical, 
              and chemists must use the correct biological name for a plant to 
              find articles about a chemical substance it produces. Not addressed 
              are those words common to all three subject areas, but that has 
              different meanings because they are part of different language games. 
              We must develop methods to more fully analyze the discourse communities 
              in various knowledge domains, scientific and non-scientific, theoretical 
              and practical. We must get a firmer grasp on the social-pragmatic 
              connotations of words and concepts in order to integrate them into 
              the semantics of semiotic nets as a basis for thesaurus building.</p>
            <p align="left"> <span class="text">As a result, one of the large 
              research areas of LIS is how to integrate bibliographic databases 
              and full-text databases into different domains, organizations, interests, 
              and levels in organization. This demands that one to distinguish 
              and characterize different domains, levels, and language games in, 
              for instance, an organization. In addition to the methods already 
              employed by LIS, these analyses will benefit from methods derived 
              from discourse and conversation analysis, as well as from socio- 
              and ethnolinguistic empirical analysis of cultural communication. 
              </span></p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> B&oslash;gh Andersen (1990) delivers 
              a semiotic framework for a computer semiotics and some applicable 
              methods from a non-LIS context. Most fields today are, at least 
              to some degree, interdisciplinary &#8211; BIOSIS is a good example, 
              as it is relevant to medicine, chemistry, and the behavioral sciences 
              &#8211; and one could for imagine that eventually interest groups 
              from different domains would develop their own systems for indexing 
              documents, so they can chose their own point of entry to these systems. 
              In addition, there will be various offers to visualize systems and 
              their language games aimed at searchers who lack domain knowledge 
              or technical search knowledge, combined with many possibilities 
              for navigation. But that is a far cry from what users want.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text">What is it many of us want? Well I want 
              the document based to be like the way I organize the books in my 
              office. I would like to be able to put in my electronic knowledge 
              profile, build up over my entire life. When I load that into the 
              system I want all the books re-indexed according to the way I define 
              the groups and index words according to my understanding and use 
              of the concepts.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Further, I think most of us do not put 
              them in alphabetic order after writer or title in our offices if 
              we have more than 100 books there, but tend to group them according 
              to various subject areas, which are again more defined from the 
              way we use them &#8211; for instance in teaching various courses 
              or participating in various research groups or projects &#8211; 
              than from some international definition of the area. Thus the ultimate 
              wish of a user of a database is that all documents with only a moments 
              notice are related to his or hers own personal knowledge profile. 
              The wish of the database designer has always been to construct the 
              perfect universal system that all users had to learn. Thus as in 
              the sciences and as in the discussion about rationality in our culture 
              we are torn between those striving towards the universal truth and 
              those who strive for meaning be it individually, culturally or even 
              universal.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> One of our civilizations great works 
              on that is Gadamer, Truth and Method, which develops the hermeneutic 
              view in a reflection also on the truth and method concepts in the 
              sciences. Peirce&#8217;s semiotics can be seen as a transdisciplinary 
              paradigm that also includes phenomenology and hermeneutics.<br>
