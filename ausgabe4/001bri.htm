             <h3>Introducing the conflict between informational and semiotic paradigms</h3>

            <p align="left"><span class="text">Two major strategies for gaining 
              a systematic understanding of the &#8220;laws&#8221; of information, 
              cognition and signification and communication are the informational 
              and the semiotic. They are both transdisciplinary and universal 
              in scope, but they study the basic ideas of information, cognition 
              and communication from disparate angles. N&ouml;th writes about 
              the relationship between these paradigms: </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="tocsmall">Information in its everyday 
                  sense is a qualitative concept associated with meaning and news. 
                  However, in the theory of information, it is a technical term, 
                  which describes only quantifiable aspects of messages. Information 
                  theory and semiotics have goals of similar analytic universality: 
                  Both study messages of any kind, but because of its strictly 
                  quantitative approach, information theory is much more restrictive 
                  in its scope. (N&ouml;th 1995: 34)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="text">This article states the conflict between 
              informational and semiotic approaches to cognition and communication 
              and points to crucial differences in the metaphysical framework 
              behind the pan-informational and the pan-semiotic paradigms as one 
              of the obstacles for making a transdisciplinary framework integrating 
              them in search of a theoretical framework that can encompass truth 
              and meaning, science and humanities. We will then take this problem 
              deep into some basic practical problems of subject searching in 
              library and information science (LIS) to show the practical limits 
              and problems of the universal theory of objective information as 
              the foundation of cognition and communication science. </p>
            <p align="left" class="text">This universal theory is often called 
              the &#8220;information-processing paradigm&#8221;. It is built on 
              an objective information concept combined with a general idea of 
              computation that is usually algorithmic. The mechanistic and rationalistic 
              information-processing paradigm prevailing in cognitive science 
              is the predominate approach in this trans-disciplinary area, which 
              is dominated by computer science and informatics. In the analysis 
              below, I demonstrate that the logical and mechanistic approach alone 
              cannot offer an understanding of human signification and its basis 
              in biological, psychological and social relationships. I then discuss 
              the ontological and epistemological problems of the idea of &#8220;information 
              science&#8221; by discussing information concepts and paradigms 
              based upon other basic epistemological and ontological theories.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In discussing the possibility of a universal 
              information science (which must include a universal science of communication 
              and cognition) it is important to analyze the nature of subject 
              areas that a universal information science has to combine, such 
              as physics, biology, social science, humanities, library and information 
              science, computer science, cybernetics, communication and linguistics. 
              The strategies for developing an information science is to extract 
              the areas of information, knowledge, perception and intelligence 
              from the old philosophical tradition and its pondering about phenomenology, 
              qualia, consciousness, meaning and signification, epistemology and 
              ontology, and instead develop an efficient objective science called 
              cognitive science. Such a move attempts to release us from more 
              than two thousand years of philosophical discussions on cognition, 
              signification and meaning, by turning the subject into an empirical 
              science.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Many information &#8220;scientists&#8221; 
              would claim that it is exactly this restriction that makes it possible 
              to construct a universal theory of information and cognition. Thus 
              the qualitative phenomenological and pragmatic approach of semiotics 
              seems to make it unsuitable for the sciences, which are presently 
              grounded in either mechanistic atomistic determinism or in some 
              type of Gibbs probabilistic complexity theory (Hayles 1999 p. 88-90 
              analysis of Wiener&#8217;s theoretical foundation and Prigogine 
              and Stengers 1984) also influenced by the uncertainty principle 
              in quantum mechanics.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> I want to consider these differences 
              as general philosophical and methodological problems for the study 
              of information, cognition, signification and communication as a 
              transdisciplinary field. The problem is basic to the entire field 
              of information, cognitive science, signification and meaning. A 
              basic inquiry is whether the functionalistic and cybernetic research 
              program of information and cognitive sciences must be seen as complementary 
              to a phenomenological-semiotic line of theorizing on signification 
              and meaning that ignores ontological questions outside culture, 
              or if they might be united into one paradigmatic framework by carrying 
              through a revision of the ontological and epistemological foundation 
              of both classical and modern science as Peirce attempts.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Essentially the mathematical theory 
              of information defines information as merely the statistical property 
              of a message, irrespective of its meaning. It is seen as a selection 
              among signals. In information theory, a signal has information when 
              it excludes the occurrence of other signals that could have occurred 
              instead. The quantification of information depends on the number 
              of excluded alternatives and the probability with which a signal 
              can be expected to occur. The informational value of a signal is 
              calculated as the probability of occurrence in a message. What counts 
              is the statistical rarity of signs, or rather, codes. Shannon&#8217;s 
              information theory, when used in a broader scientific sense, presumes 
              that signals are meaningful codes established in a system of signs, 
              such as the Morse code for the alphabet. In this situation one can 
              relate this information concept to the quantitative side of meaningful 
              communication without addressing the presupposed meaning that makes 
              the calculation worth doing. But Norbert Wiener, the father of cybernetics, 
              made a more general theory of information, saying that &#8216;information 
              is information, neither energy nor matter&#8217;, but something 
              real in nature being everywhere (pan-informational paradigm), and 
              as Schr&ouml;dinger (1967) showed in his book What is life?, is 
              being especially crucial for living systems.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The modern versions of the pan-informational 
              paradigm often combine functionalism with the non-equilibrium thermodynamics, 
              non-linear systems dynamics, and deterministic chaos theory and 
              fractal mathematics as descriptive tools. But again there are seldom 
              systematic reflections on how they differ from a mechanistic view 
              or on the nature of a concept of meaning and how signification arises 
              in minds. This is a general philosophical problem in the area of 
              &#8220;psychology&#8221; and &#8220;cognitive science&#8221;. At 
              least two of the methodologies in the area of human behavior, thinking 
              and communication, presume that humans are meaning-producing systems. 
              These are the phenomenological and hermeneutical qualitative approaches. 
            </p>
            <p align="left" class="text">The large differences between the scientific 
              approaches on the one side and the phenomenological-hermeneutical 
              approaches on the other still fuel the debate as to whether psychology 
              can ever establish itself as one science, though cognitive science 
              and the information-processing paradigm are themselves such attempts 
              that ignore the problems of meaning that phenomenology, hermeneutics 
              and semiotics address.<a name="pei"></a></p>
            <h3>Peircean based pan semiotics</h3>
            <p align="left" class="text"> Within the last twenty years a semiotic 
              and communicational paradigm, largely based on Peirce&#8217;s &#8220;(&#8230;) 
              semiotics, that is, the doctrine of the essential nature and fundamental 
              varieties of possible semiosis.&#8221; (Peirce, CP: 5.448) has developed. 
              Semiotics develops a general theory of all possible kinds of signs, 
              their modes of signification and information, and whole behavior 
              and properties. It studies the existence of meaningful communication 
              in living and social systems and looks to cultural historical dynamics 
              and evolutionary ecology for explanations of the dynamics of signification 
              and communication. Peirce founded semiotics as a logic and scientific 
              study of dynamic sign action in humans, their language, science 
              and religion and other cultural products as well as sign in non-human 
              nature. In the form of biosemiotics, this view is now penetrating 
              biology as an alternative to both mechanistic and purely systems&#8217; 
              dynamical explanations. Work has been undertaken in genetics, molecular 
              biology and biochemistry (Hoffmeyer and Emmeche, 1991, Barbieri 
              2001), organic chemistry.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> A pan-semiotic philosophy can be constructed 
              from a few central quotations from Peirce. The first pertains to 
              the ontological question of the basic elements of reality:</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="tocsmall">The entire universe is perfused 
                  with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs.<br>
                  (Peirce, CP: 5.448, fn.)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In other words, in thinking we never 
              have access to the thing in itself, but only as it appear to us 
              through signs. Since we are living in a &#8220;semiosphere&#8221; 
              (Hoffmeyer 1997) in our individual and collective &#8220;signification 
              spheres&#8221;, we never get &#8220;behind&#8221; the signs to &#8220;reality.&#8221; 
              So why not admit that signs are the only reality we will ever know? 
              Even humans are only signs.</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="tocsmall">For, as the fact that every 
                  thought is a sign, taken in conjunction with the fact that life 
                  is a train of thought, proves that man is a sign; so, that every 
                  thought is an external sign, proves that man is an external 
                  sign. That is to say, the man and the external sign are identical, 
                  in the same sense in which the words homo and man are identical. 
                  Thus my language is the sum total of myself; for the man is 
                  the thought. (Peirce, CP: 5.318)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In this view, semiotics becomes the 
              fundamental doctrine and philosophy to grasp knowing and reality. 
              Still, a prerequisite for signs to work as tools for cognition is 
              a basic pre-coupling between the organism and the environment. One 
              has to know where to look and what to look for in order to obtain 
              further information from a sign. Peirce writes:</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p align="justify" class="tocsmall">The sign can only represent 
                  the object and tell about it. It cannot furnish acquaintance 
                  with a recognition of that object. (&#8230;) It presupposes 
                  an acquaintance in order to convey some further information 
                  concerning it. (Peirce, CP: 2.231)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The problem is whether this acquaintance 
              presupposes certain pre-semiotic experiences as does much of hermeneutic 
              philosophy. Regardless, in semiotics, meaning and signification 
              do not have much to do with informational bits. The phenomenological 
              theory established in Peirce&#8217;s semiotics underlines the fact 
              that qualia, interpretation and meaning are at least as important 
              as the quantitative selection and measuring of bits.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> In Peirce&#8217;s triadic philosophy, 
              feelings, qualia, habit formation, and signification are basic ontological 
              constituents of reality. This suggests that the semiotic paradigm 
              should be able to penetrate beyond chemistry and physics to &#8220;the 
              bottom of nature&#8221;. This seems to clash with basic beliefs 
              in sizable parts of information science that seems to want to construct 
              meaning as a bottom up procedure from a thermodynamically based 
              information science. </p>
            <p align="left" class="text">We seem to have two completely distinct 
              points of departure for these theories that both aim to be universal. 
              The difference between the two paradigms is fundamental. The information 
              paradigm is based on an objective, quantitative information concept 
              working with algorithmic models of perception, cognition and communication. 
              Semiotics, based in human language&#8217;s meaningful communication, 
              is phenomenological and dependent upon a theory of meaning.</p>
            <p align="justify" class="text"> One way of viewing the problem is 
              to see the pan-informational paradigm as a &#8220;bottom-up&#8221; 
              explanation and the pan-semiotic paradigm as a &#8220;top-down&#8221; 
              explanation. One could further combine this with an epistemological 
              viewpoint that suggests that no final scientific explanations can 
              be given to anything in this world, including the behavior of organisms. 
              All we have are complementary explanations that work well in different 
              situations. We can never attain a full view.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> According to this, it might be impossible 
              to unite the two paradigms by manipulating basic definitions into 
              unifying compromises. Instead we should continue to develop each 
              paradigm to its fullest and then combine them as complementary views 
              of a subject matter we can never fully grasp in any kind of unified 
              scientific systems of concepts and laws (see Figure 1).<a name="fig1"></a></p>

                  semiotic view in the area of the foundation of information science. 
                  On the left side is a hierarchy of sciences and their objects, 
                  from physics to humanities and vice versa. On the right is an 
                  illustration of the two most common &#8220;scientific&#8221; 
                  schemes for understanding and predicting communicative and organizational 
                  behavior: <br>
                  <br>
                  1. the semiotic top-down paradigm of signification, cognition 
                  and communicative, and<br>
                  <br>
                  2. the informational bottom-up functionalistic view of organization, 
                  signal transmission and A.I. <br>
                  <br>
                  The width of the two paradigms in correlation with the various 
                  subject areas shows an estimate of how the relevance of the 
                  paradigm is generally considered, although both claim to encompass 
                  the entire spectrum. [</span><a href="#content" class="back">back</a><span class="erklaerung">]</small></p>

            <p align="left" class="text">One of the consequences of this is that 
              concepts of meaning and the objective statistical information concept 
              are defined within two distinct paradigms, making the informational 
              aspect of communication as an objective and quantifiable entity 
              completely independent of any meaningful interpretation from the 
              recipient and any intent from the sender. </p>
            <p align="left" class="text">The opposition between the two paradigms 
              has another important aspect. It is a confrontation between the 
              scientific and objectivistic realistic views of knowledge and science 
              and the phenomenological-hermeneutic-humanistic approach to meaning, 
              signification and communication. This makes it very difficult to 
              make a unifying theory for LIS that encompasses both the algorithmic 
              way of dealing with intelligence, knowledge and communication in 
              the computer, the social understanding of how meaning is created 
              and evolved in natural languages and finally psychologically how 
              the individual user in front of a document retrieval system actually 
              understands concepts, strings of words, what documents are about 
              and the actual content of documents, since our aim is to organize 
              the retrieval process in a natural way to make the enormous number 
              of documents produced internationally widely available.<a name="doc"></a></p>
            <h3>The document-mediating system</h3>
            <p align="left" class="text"> The main expertise of librarians, archivists 
              and documentalists has always been the storage, indexing, retrieval 
              and mediation of materials carrying data, knowledge, meaning and 
              experience. As a science, its objective is first and foremost to 
              promote communication. This can include recorded measurements and 
              observations, theoretical knowledge, and meanings and visions or 
              experiences, to such media as documents, books, records, tapes, 
              programs, floppy discs, hypertext, compact discs, pictures, films 
              and videograms, from the producer to the user. These mediating forms 
              and future ones can be summarized under the general LIS-concept 
              of a &#8220;document&#8221; (see e.g. Vickery &amp; Vickery 1987, 
              Buckland 1991). Following Buckland&#8217;s discussion, I will define 
              a document as a human work with communicative intent towards other 
              living beings that is recorded in a material way.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> For librarians and documentalists, information 
              science is primarily concerned with finding the most suitable rules 
              for the design of systems and procedures for collecting, organizing, 
              classifying, indexing, storing, retrieving and mediating those materials 
              which support data, knowledge, meaning and experience. Librarians, 
              documentalists and archivists have done this for thousands of years.</p>
            <p align="left" class="text"> As an offshoot of both indexing and 
              communication to users with different requirements, one must study 
              the origins of the various document types, how they are produced, 
              for which users, and under what economic knowledge domain constraints. 
              It is recognized that producers of documents generally have specific 
              consumers in mind, and these consumers can often be manufacturers 
              themselves. In this way the system closes in upon itself, as Luhmann 
              (1995) underlines for communication systems in general, and then 
              cannot see its surrounding society and culture directly.</p>

              <p>But it does react to the perturbation and change in the production 
              and use of document types through internal adjustment. This is shown 
              in Figure 2 where the broken arrows represent a structure or result-changing 
              feedback that is vital for the system's self-organizing ability 
              and its ability to survive through self-adjustment.<a name="fig2"></a></p>
            <p align="justify" class="text"><a href="001bri_img2.htm" target="img"><img src="bilder/sbrier/img2_b.gif" alt="" border="0" class="smallborder"></a></p>
            <p><small>Figure 2:<br>
                  The document-mediating information system as a self-organizing 
                  cybersemiotic system with semantic feedback. The unbroken arrows 
                  are document transport. The broken arrows are feedback in the 
                  form of approval or critique of the contents of documents or 
                  of system performance. <br>
                  1. The direct circulation of documents between producer and 
                  user is often seen in the sciences with preprints. 2. The direct 
                  access of librarians to a collection. 3. End-user&#8217;s access 
                  directly through on-line systems. 4. The librarian as mediator 
                  of the collection through mechanical (electronic) intermediaries. 
                  5. An information broker&#8217;s mediation of documents to a 
                  user.</small></p>
            
             <p><span class="text">This is one of the developments &#8211; along 
              with the development of cognitive science &#8211; that promoted 
              the idea of a unified information science for humans, machines and 
              animals (see for instance Vickery &amp; Vickery 1988). As mentioned 
              previously, the hope of cognitive science is that information-processing 
              will follow certain &#8220;universal syntactic, logical and mathematical 
              laws&#8221; (Fodor 1987).</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> One should reflect on the fact that nearly 
              everything, aside from computer programs found on the Internet and 
              in all management information systems, is a document. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Therefore this problem is very general and has 
              massive proportions. The first goal is to make intelligent user 
              interfaces. The second is to reorganize databases. The latter does 
              not seem practical or economically feasible for most of the huge 
              international scientific bibliographic databases, since each is 
              built with a rigid scientific classification or thesaurus that controls 
              its indexing practices. Further, they house millions of documents 
              that are already indexed.</span>
