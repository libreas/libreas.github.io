    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">Just when you thought catalogers had been relegated 
              to the back rooms for good, they&#8217;ve come out in droves with 
              35 essays ranging from Library of Congress Subject Headings (a hot 
              topic), folk art terminology, zines and Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgender 
              (GLBT) visibility in catalogs. This new book from McFarland is a 
              collection of anecdotes, words to the wise and criticisms from catalogers 
              on the front lines.</p>
            <p class="text">This is the rabble-rousers&#8217; introduction to 
              cataloging. Those who &#8220;revel in the secret handshake of the 
              MARC fraternity&#8221; (Smith in his essay) will read with an experienced 
              nod, but those who aren&#8217;t catalogers, or even librarians for 
              that matter, will enjoy most of the essays in this 303-page book.</p>
            <p class="text">Roberto first started using the term &#8220;radical 
              cataloging&#8221; around 2002. The term fits into the broader category 
              of &#8220;radical librarianship&#8221;, a tradition that&#8217;s 
              been around for decades, referring to progressive, radical, and 
              socially responsible library work, attitude, and outreach. There&#8217;s 
              much discussion throughout the book on what role cataloging plays 
              in the greater scheme of things and what a radical cataloger is. 
              In the Preface, Roberto details the behaviors and traits of a radical 
              cataloger. They include: &#8220;Being user-focused with regard to 
              your library&#8217;s users. [&#8230;] Skepticism about the quality 
              of readily available bibliographic records. [&#8230;] Appreciating 
              traditional cataloging models while examining ways to integrate 
              new and useful ideas into this framework without abandoning what 
              already works. [&#8230;] Feeling passionate about cataloging and 
              its benefits.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Cataloging has been under attack in the past few years, 
              and many essays touch on this. A main focus of concern is Karen 
              Calhoun&#8217;s 2006 report for the Library of Congress questioning 
              the value of library catalogs and the catalogers maintaining them. 
              Unarguably, cataloging is expensive, and the question has been raised 
              if that expense is justifiable. Weinberg details in her essay, &#8220;Cataloging 
              in Non-Roman Scripts&#8221;, that in the United States, cataloging 
              in non-Roman scripts is considered a radical cataloging practice. 
              Some of Sanford Berman&#8217;s &#8220;radical and progressive&#8221; 
              ideas of thirty+ years ago are now considered standards. This book 
              examines what is considered radical cataloging, and more broadly, 
              librarianship, and spends time focusing on traditional biases in 
              the traditional catalog.</p>
            <p class="text">The purpose of this anthology as stated in the Preface 
              is as follows: &#8220;[&#8230;] to serve as a tool for catalogers 
              and cataloging advocates.&#8221; It is broken into three sections: 
              Cataloging in Context, with historical overviews, and personal and 
              theory-heavy essays. The second, We Criticize Because We Care, concentrates 
              on criticisms of contemporary cataloging (including a scathing review 
              of OCLC and the predictable grumblings about Library of Congress 
              Subject Headings). The final section, Innovative Practices introduces 
              readers to new projects to increase the use of catalogs, including 
              pieces on teaching radical cataloging, cataloging zines, and tagging 
              and other forms of folksonomies.</p>
            <p class="text">Some themes that continue to emerge throughout the 
              book are issues with and advantages of Web 2.0 techniques in and 
              around the catalog, how to sufficiently represent minors, whether 
              they be race, sexual identity, or gender, and of course, the inadequacies 
              and blatant biases and tiltings of cataloging mega-forces like OCLC 
              and the Library of Congress. The most hilarious (and my favorite) 
              essay is Christopher H. Walker&#8217;s &#8220;Rearranging the Deck 
              Chairs on the Titanic: A Drowning Cataloger&#8217;s Call to Stop 
              Churning the Subject Headings&#8221;. Written in a chatty conversational 
              tone, Walker approaches a subject so well-worn it seemed predictable 
              and surprises with a commentary on social change and progress through 
              LC&#8217;s eyes.</p>
            <p class="text">Jenna Freedman&#8217;s essay, &#8220;AACR2-Bendable 
              but Not Flexible: Cataloging Zines at Barnard College&#8221; details 
              the mysterious world of zine cataloging. Brian Hasenstab takes us 
              on &#8220;A Highly Selective, Slightly Irreverent Trip Down Radical 
              Cataloging Literature Lane&#8221;- the subtitle of his collection 
              of mini book reviews, in &#8220;This Subfield Kills Fascists.&#8221; 
              A title like that doesn&#8217;t come along everyday. Jeffery Beall&#8217;s 
              review of OCLC leaves no stones unturned in exposing it as a money 
              and power-mongering multinational corporation lurking in our catalog&#8217;s 
              backyards. And of course, many authors throughout mentioned Sanford 
              Berman.</p>
            <p class="text">In a way, Sanford Berman laid the foundation for radical 
              cataloging. Without having a name for it, he single-handedly led 
              a crusade against the Library of Congress and their questionable 
              headings, created a new subject authority file that he implemented 
              at Hennepin County Library during his influential time there, and 
              many of which the LC finally incorporated. He has long promoted 
              alternative viewpoints in librarianship. This book, and review of 
              it, would be incomplete without recognizing the immense impact he 
              has had on the subfield of radical cataloging. His ideas that were 
              considered revolutionary have now become commonplace library procedures.</p>
            <p class="text">The Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH) that 
              Sanford Berman has railed against for so long continue to be criticized 
              throughout the book. He called the headings &#8220;chauvinistic&#8221;; 
              others call them biased, racist, sexist, and unjust. &#8220;A Hidden 
              History of Queer Subject Access&#8221; delves into the topic surrounding 
              access to GLBT materials, and their bibliocide due to the lack of 
              adequate headings. Tatiana de la Tierra expands on this theme with 
              &#8220;Latina Lesbian Subject Headings: The Power of Naming&#8221;. 
              She points out that: &#8220;Library of Congress subject headings 
              do not name the complete gamut of sexual expressions&#8221;, and 
              that &#8220;Subject headings carry a lot of weight. The [&#8230;] 
              wrong [subject headings], or none at all, can cut off access...&#8221; 
              Although LCSH is the largest subject thesaurus in the universe, 
              their progress is continuously pointed out as being pathetic and 
              antiquated. Christopher H. Walker brings the reader through a brief 
              history of the modern era by way of LCSH; which headings are passed 
              that should have been a long time ago, which we now has no need 
              for, and which are reflective of a larger view of society. Love 
              them or hate them, LCSH get a lot of attention in Radical Cataloging.</p>

              <p>Another topic with almost equal attention paid is the topic of tagging, 
              and ultimately, Library 2.0. Several essayists fret about Amazon.com&#8217;s 
              encroaching success in user searching, review functions and suggesting 
              similar titles, a capitalist approach to reader&#8217;s advisory 
              services. Tagging is wildly popular in user-driven programs like 
              Flickr, LibraryThing, and del.icio.us. Again and again, the argument 
              is made that libraries must keep up with these developments and 
              innovations, or run the risk of losing users&#8217; to The Google 
              Empire. Cataloging has come out of hiding in mysterious back rooms 
              and into every social networking site user&#8217;s hands. LibraryThing 
              catalogers are connected to the Library of Congress or Amazon.com 
              by default when cataloging personal collections. </p>
            <p class="text">LibraryThing developers seem to place equal value 
              on these two organization&#8217;s cataloging records. What message 
              is this sending to users? Will catalogers be replaced by the tagging 
              masses? Will users be drawn in by the layperson terminology of tagging, 
              foregoing the often archaic language of more traditional cataloging 
              tools like LCSH? In &#8220;Ubiquitous Cataloging&#8221;, Bradley 
              Dilger and William Thompson take on these questions in a wildly 
              informative essay. They reveal that LibraryThing&#8217;s author 
              and title &#8220;clouds&#8221; show that J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. 
              Tolkien are the most heavily collected authors on the site. Tools 
              like tag clouds could be used in libraries to connect users with 
              information never exposed before - and could change collection development, 
              if it becomes obvious that patrons want popular fiction rather than 
              the canon. The authors suggest a &#8220;more participatory catalog 
              [...] [that] would situate this debate between readers themselves, 
              via the catalog (in user groups, for example).&#8221; They excitedly 
              imply that allowing users to add tags to a library catalog could 
              make cataloging a more open-ended process, with end results beyond 
              any professional cataloger&#8217;s wildest imagination. New connections 
              could be made that never were explored before. Maybe catalogers 
              would even accept user-suggested tags into their bibliographic records 
              and their hearts. Sites like del.icio.us suggest tags that other 
              users have used for our bookmarked websites. Finally, Dilger and 
              Thompson concede that tagging does have its critics: &#8221;While 
              tagging and its much ballyhooed companion &#8216;folksonomy&#8217; 
              (classification by amateurs, as opposed to &#8216;taxonomy&#8217; 
              created by experts) aren&#8217;t going to automatically revolutionize 
              the art and craft of cataloging, they remain valuable tools for 
              reaching the larger goals we&#8217;ve set out as cataloging moves 
              toward ubiquity.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">With taggers breaking away from the constraints of 
              LCSH, many of which didn&#8217;t know those chains were there to 
              break free from, the concept of what and who warrants an official 
              cataloger is blurry. Tagging&#8217;s main function is providing 
              a pathway for easy access to information, so is traditional cataloging. 
              Taggers base their tags off of the work&#8217;s content; catalogers 
              have been working from the &#8220;work in hand&#8221;. Where will 
              the two meet and who will be there to facilitate this merger?</p>
            <p><span class="text">An underlying theme of the book is librarian 
              as activist. Librarian as advocate for a cause they feel strongly 
              about, consider themselves experts on, or have been affected by 
              directly. Whether it be GLBT issues, Native American names in catalogs, 
              or the treatment of religious sects, this anthology embodies the 
              idea of not only a &#8220;radical cataloger&#8221;, but a &#8220;radical 
              librarian&#8221;. Without which the field will be lost to corporations 
              like OCLC, Amazon.com and Google. And without which the world, and 
              our bibliographic records, will be a much more boring place. </p>

              <p>Radical Cataloging is strongly recommended for anyone curious about, 
              invested in, or bored by cataloging. Almost all of the essays bring 
              a new light on the broad topic. Only a few essays are extraordinarily 
              dense or academic; most are entertaining, informative and most of 
              all, radical in thought. A daring ideology all libraries need more 
              of.</span> </p></div>
