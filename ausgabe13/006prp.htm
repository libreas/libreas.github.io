    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p> <span class="text">Crafty librarians. Crafts about librarians. 
              What is going on on the craft scene? The newest Sublime Stichery 
              (embroidery patterns for hipsters) came out recently, with sexy 
              librarians as one of the main designs they are promoting. There 
              has been an influx lately of handmade librarian swag. I am interested 
              in how the &#8220;common people&#8221; are portraying themselves/librarians, 
              rather than the media or capitalist corporations, often so tied 
              to the media anyway. I have a lot more questions than answers.<br>
              Now, it may be there have always been librarians ecstatic about 
              crafting, but the world had no idea until now, with online forums, 
              blogs and message boards. I&#8217;ve been following two of those 
              websites: Etsy</span><span>[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span>]</span><span> 
              </span><span class="text"> and Craftster </span><span>[<a name="f2b" id="f2b"></a></span><a href="#f2" class="back">Fn2</a><span>]</span><span class="text">.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> Etsy is an online marketplace for all things 
              handmade, including crafting supplies and vintage goods. Crafters 
              are able to set up a (usually) free online store, post pictures 
              of their handmade wares, pay a nominal fee for listing and when 
              they sell, and, to many librarians&#8217; interest, tag their items 
              for the best findability. For instance, a zine about mustaches will 
              be tagged: zine, screenprint (to describe the cover), hand-bound 
              or staple-bound, mustache, interviews, freebie, etc. The incentive 
              for tagging isn&#8217;t only to find information, &agrave; la library 
              catalog searching, but it really is in sellers&#8217; best interest 
              to be thorough and broad with their tagging in hopes of increasing 
              the likelihood that buyers will stumble upon it. When I am looking 
              for an item featuring ostriches (which is often), all I have to 
              do is type &#8220;ostrich&#8221; into the search engine, and then 
              I am faced with ostrich feathers, ostrich-leather belts, and bags 
              with ostriches stenciled on them. Etsy has a messaging function, 
              and a forum for showing off your finished projects, asking questions 
              about materials, and setting up swaps between crafters.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> Craftster functions as a forum and discussion 
              board for all things craft. It is not a site that sells items, but 
              rather, connects crafters ranging from knitters to shoemakers to 
              screenprinters. There is an insane amount of information on Craftster, 
              and all types of forums to explore.<br>
              The similarity between these two prominent crafting sites is the 
              heavy population of librarians. It seems librarians represent themselves 
              much more fully than, say, veterinarians or accountants. They often 
              have the word &#8220;librarian&#8221; in their username, and use 
              it as an identity, extending far from an occupation or career. Some 
              use the sites as a way to meet other crafting librarians, as it 
              seems crafters like to work in groups. Some use it as a way of bragging 
              about their library lives, and others seem to feel they represent 
              librarians world-wide. Whatever the case, there is an exorbitant 
              amount of librarian crafters.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> Search for &#8220;librarian&#8221; or &#8220;library&#8221; 
              on Etsy and you&#8217;ll come up with hundreds of hits. Cufflinks. 
              Paintings. The card catalog is printed on everything from clothing 
              to greeting cards, with a nostalgia for older analog times. Actual 
              catalog cards are used for bookplates and birthday cards; librarian 
              stationery is suggested as gifts for a librarian, and some items 
              that come up when &#8220;librarian&#8221; is searched for don&#8217;t 
              even portray a librarian. These images are meant to sum up the idea 
              of a librarian, for instance a necklace with antique glasses frames 
              and a key to &#8220;hidden knowledge&#8221;. A handmade pencil skirt 
              with a thin (always!) woman looking off into the distance, deep 
              in thought, touting &#8220;librarian chic&#8221; and &#8220;establishment&#8221;, 
              the new fashion trend sweeping the nation, another story altogether. 
              A few of these crafts are for the activist. &#8220;Book Power&#8221; 
              proclaims a T-shirt, with Black Panther-like fists in the air, only 
              holding books. Librarians are able to proclaim their status in the 
              world, with a black acrylic necklace so large it&#8217;s practically 
              covering both collarbones, stating in bold: Librarian. Not all these 
              crafts are made by librarians, and there seem to be two camps: Those 
              continuing the typical image of a librarian, and those aimed at 
              &#8220;radical librarians&#8221;.<br>
              <br>
              </span><span class="text"><img src="bilder/due_date.jpg" width="430" height="430" border="1"><br>
              <br>
              T-shirts, buttons, eco-friendly mugs and even infant onesies are 
              available from the artist handmade marketplace, Buyolympia.com touting 
              &#8220;Reading is Sexy&#8221;, &#8220;Future Librarian&#8221;, or 
              my favorite, and for all you guys: &#8220;Guybrarian&#8221;. This 
              guybrarian (need it be explained-a guy librarian) shirt is the only 
              mention of a male in the field that I encountered in months of searching. 
              To include the word &#8220;guy&#8221; implies that the standard 
              for librarians is a woman. Recently the New York Times published 
              an article about &#8220;hipster librarians.&#8221; </span><span>[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span></span><span>]</span> 
              <span class="text">Included in it were representatives from both 
              sexes, with an emphasis on librarianship as the hip new thing among 
              the in-the-know. However, the men were an anomaly, almost a novelty.
              <br>
              <img src="bilder/guybrarian_black_med.jpg" width="342" height="300" border="1"><br>
              <br>
              Librarianship has traditionally been a woman&#8217;s career, and 
              crafting (especially knitting and sewing) has been considered domestic 
              work. Does the term &#8220;women&#8217;s work&#8221; cross boundaries 
              here, to collide in a blazing feminist explosion? As knitting and 
              all homemade, Do-It-Yourself projects are in vogue, could it be 
              that librarians who are also crafters are asserting their feminist 
              views through their crafting librarian identities? Librarians are 
              quite capable creatures. The DIY ethic seems to appeal to their 
              sensibilities of finding information on any topic of interest, and 
              turning that information into usable skills.<br>
              <br>
              <img src="bilder/librarians_in_love.jpg" width="430" height="526" border="1"> 
              </span><span class="text"><br>
              <br>
              Interestingly, almost all of the crafts portraying librarians somehow 
              tie in the sexy librarian stereotype, or, barring that, showcase 
              a librarian either already in love, or waiting for Mr. (or Ms.-this 
              is the 21st century) Right, supplying flirty puns on sexiness or 
              &#8220;checking someone out&#8221;. Many feature the 1950s idea 
              of a librarian-a single (white) female in her mid-20s to 30s wearing 
              a pencil skirt, button-up blouse, and without fail, glasses. The 
              characters are always portrayed as avid readers, loving books, dispensing 
              witty and well-informed conversation, and ultimately, &#8220;letting 
              her hair down&#8221; so to speak. Why is the idea of &#8220;sexy&#8221; 
              inextricably linked with the ideal librarian? Obviously, our culture 
              both reveres and fears an intelligent woman. Can&#8217;t a woman 
              be intelligent without having her intelligence be a sexual attractant? 
              Yes, brains are sexy, but nerds typically aren&#8217;t considered 
              as such, so in order to enable this fetish that has been long-running, 
              we make an exception. Women haven&#8217;t been visible in the workforce 
              for that long, compared to men, so when a woman holds a position 
              with a prerequisite of intelligence, it is easier to see her as 
              a sex object.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> In a lot of ways these crafts are touching 
              on this idea of gender inequality and pigeonholing, some tongue-in-cheek, 
              others without considering they are reinforcing this stereotype. 
              Some see it as kitschy, some see it as a reclamation, and some see 
              it as a way to make a buck. With the baby boom generation of librarians 
              gradually easing into retirement, it might be time for a new image 
              of a librarian-one with a book about Doing It Ourselves in one hand 
              and the other in a raised fist. Book Power.</span><br>
