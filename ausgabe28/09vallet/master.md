### Introduction

Public libraries are confronted with numerous societal challenges that
influence their functions, profile and identity. The realization of a
livable city, a more inclusive society and a learning or knowledge
society are only a few examples of these societal challenges
(Crowhurst-Lennard and Lennard, 1994; Smith, 1996; Evans, 2002; Geller,
2003; Sproull and Patterson, 2004; Lees, Slater and Wyly, 2007; Mellon,
2009; Brown-Saracino, 2010).

As such, the overall image of a public library is clearly dynamic in
nature. And although this dynamic nature is nowadays intensively
discussed within the world of public libraries (Aabø, 2005; MacLennan,
2007; Dahlkild, 2011, Vallet, 2013), its origin, precise features and
impact on society is certainly not yet fully understood, neither by
library practitioners nor by academics. This is presumably also the
reason why an overall awareness of this changing identity far beyond the
borders of the public library world itself may certainly not be
considered to be self-evident. The awareness of librarians and library
scientists is clearly growing, but not necessarily the awareness of
partners (e.g. educational institutions, public social workers) nor
users (e.g. individual citizens, communities). In two recent research
initiatives on the changing strategic roles of public libraries (Vallet
2013, 2015), we discovered for instance that political and
administrative policy makers of Flemish cities – who finance and invest
in public libraries – do not always fully know and comprehend the "new"
ambitions and associated identities of Flemish public libraries. One can
argue that these new ambitions may be too scarce or even generated
within a (too) isolated or "library in-crowd" setting. But that has
clearly not been the case. Over the past few years, the Flemish platform
of public libraries Bibnet & LOCUS has for instance organized several
information and interactive brainstorm sessions to discuss societal
challenges for public libraries and to promote new (shared) concepts and
innovative ideas. Additionally, after the local elections in 2012 all
Flemish public libraries have presented their formal library plan
including their (new) future ambitions for the next five years to their
new local governments in order to jointly elaborate the so-called local
strategic plan imposed by the Flemish government. Thus, the presence or
absence of awareness as well as the way(s) in which this awareness can
be triggered or hindered, do become interesting points of attention when
reflecting on the changing identity or image of public libraries.

Within this article we will focus on these two points of attention for a
particular user group (bachelor students of interior architecture at the
University of Antwerp, Belgium). The central theme of their
bachelor-proof assignment in 2015 was the (re)design of Flemish public
libraries in view of their (new) strategic ambitions and the underlying
societal challenges. The main interest of the teaching staff was to
check whether the interior architecture students were capable of making
and developing "fitting", this means practically relevant and useful
interior designs for the previously described central theme.
Notwithstanding this outspoken pedagogical ambition, the actual
realization of the assignment generated additional insights into the
presence and "design-triggered" awareness of the changing identity of
Flemish public libraries by these bachelor students.

This article will report on the specific nature of these additional
insights. Subsequently, we will focus on the following two-folded
research question: (i) what do we learn from the realization of the
bachelor-proof assignment on the awareness of the changing identity of
Flemish public libraries by bachelor-students of interior architecture,
and (ii) in what way can the realization of the design assignment itself
influence, stimulate and trigger this particular awareness; or what are
the (presumably) underlying "enablers" and "disablers"?

In order to answer this research question, we have held an explicit
focus-group debate and evaluation with all members of the teaching staff
and an additional colleague specialized in the essence and profile of
the interior architecture discipline. In the near future, this
information will be confronted with the additional experiences of the
students themselves and the public libraries involved. Thus, we will
obtain a kind of reflective discourse that will allow us to make some
critical end-remarks on the final lessons learned. Notwithstanding these
future activities, the present focus-group debate with the staff members
already generates some interesting in-depth results.

The structure of the article is as follows. In a first paragraph we give
some additional background information on the precise nature of the
bachelor-proof assignment. In the next three paragraphs we will report
on the gained insights of the teaching staff. Subsequently, we will
focus on (i) the initially observed notions of the students on the
changing identity of Flemish public libraries, (ii) the observed changes
in their notions as the design-assignment evolved and ended over time,
and (iii) the uncovered enablers (triggers) and disablers (obstacles) of
these changes throughout the design-assignment as perceived and depicted
by the teaching staff. In the last paragraph we will also give some
suggestions to public libraries and teachers to (better) encounter these
disablers.

### The assignment - diving into the deep blue sea

When describing the essence of their assignment, approximately 60
bachelor-students were asked to translate the new ambitions and changing
identity of two Flemish public libraries in "fitting" alternative
interior designs:

-   On the one hand, it concerned a project within the city of Kortrijk
    (Belgium) where the explicit (new) identity of a so-called
    "neighborhood herald"[^1] (Vallet, 2013) resulted in the ambition to
    create tailor-made library branches that would fit the specific
    profile of each urban quarter. In the assignment, the neighborhood
    of the "Lange Munte" was taken into consideration. Thus, the
    assignment was focused on the creation of an interior library branch
    design that should stimulate the presently absent social cohesion
    within "Lange Munte" between different types of inhabitants being
    (i) isolated and impoverished middle-class senior citizens, (ii)
    poor and not (yet fully) integrated immigrants covering more than 20
    nationalities, and (iii) young families that are expected to move to
    the neighborhood in view of a new (but still to be built) housing
    project. The library branch "Lange Munte" had to be built or set up
    within a vast reconverted church building of the Seventies. To
    guarantee the previously described ambitions, the church building
    should also (i) give shelter to the existing urban neighborhood
    center and (ii) support the activities and encounter initiatives of
    individual citizens as well as neighborhood societies (e.g. local
    brass bands, theatre groups, reading clubs). Thus, an original
    "joint" set up within an open (church) building was the major
    challenge of this highly conceptual interior design (i.e. in a
    conceptual design the central idea and main features of the overall
    design are crucial).

-   On the other hand, it concerned a project within the municipality of
    Destelbergen near the city of Ghent (Belgium) where the explicit
    (new) identity of a so-called "target group patron"[^2] (Vallet,
    2013) resulted in the ambition to create a so-called "house of the
    child" within one existing library branch. As such, this library
    branch should not only focus itself on the information, education,
    cultural participation and dwelling needs of children from the age
    of 1 up to the age of 18 years, but should also give shelter to
    other public and social profit organizations that provide
    specialized services to the same target group (e.g. a medical
    childcare center for babies and toddlers, a multifunctional space
    for creative workshops and storytelling, and a garden for outdoor
    recreation). The library branch "house of the child" was located in
    a very new and modern, but rather small-scaled cubic building. Thus,
    a high concentration of different functions and organizations on a
    relatively small surface was the major challenge of this rather
    practical interior design (i.e. in a practical design the
    operational feasibility and details of the design are crucial).

In order to realize the interior design assignment, the teaching staff
elaborated the following support and feedback procedure:

-   At the start in February 2015, the students received two initial
    lectures on the changing roles and identities of public libraries
    throughout Europe and even throughout the entire world. These
    lectures were not only based on scientific research (e.g.
    publications and research reports), but were also illustrated by
    examples that visually reflected the immense variety of the changing
    identities (e.g. photographs, pictures, sketches and plans of the
    interior). After all, students in interior architecture are very
    sensitive and susceptible to visual representations. These
    representations show how a "space" is actually crafted, molded and
    modified in view of a certain (preferred) mental and behavioral
    conduct or experience of people dwelling and using this space. By
    using visual representations, the teaching staff wanted to be sure
    that the story of the changing images of public libraries actually
    matched the general interest and familiar "world" of their students.
    Combined, the textual and visual information should therefore
    certainly stimulate their awareness.

-   Immediately after the lectures, the students were given a short
    initiating assignment. They had to collect images of public
    libraries that they themselves found fascinating in view of a
    particular (changing) identity of these public libraries. As such,
    the students made use of (i) the internet, (ii) the collection and
    archives of the university library and (iii) informal visits to some
    public libraries within Flanders. To support them, the teaching
    staff provided them with a list of inspiring examples. To make sure
    that their inspirational search would not be too limited, the
    teaching staff also motivated the students to have a close look at
    related initiatives, like for instance some interesting community
    centers, urban encounter initiatives, museums for children, child
    day-care centers and primary schools. Taken together, this mainly
    self-organized search by the students should furthermore trigger
    their awareness.

-   In addition to the previously described lectures and initiating
    assignment, a trip to the premises of both public libraries was also
    organized. During these visits, the teaching staff made sure that
    the students were confronted with the ambitions of the different
    stakeholders involved (e.g. oral presentations, questions asked by
    the students, hands-out of policy documents and architectural
    plans). After all, the changing identity is not only created or
    determined by the library director, but also by the public library
    staff (e.g. daily activities and initiatives), the political
    alderman of culture (e.g. local financing facilities), the
    administrative director of the local cultural policy (e.g.
    embeddedness in the cultural strategic plan of the municipality or
    city), the municipal or urban social welfare team (e.g. related
    social ambitions), the Flemish platform of Bibnet & LOCUS (e.g.
    related ambitions and financing facilities on the Flemish policy
    level) and representatives of the partners to be involved (e.g.
    those who will get shelter within the same building: see before). As
    such, the teaching staff wanted to be sure that the students
    received an in-depth, well differentiated and real-life picture of
    the changing identities involved. Taken together, these different
    ambitions should additionally trigger an especially nuanced,
    non-cliché, non-stereotype awareness that would form the basis of an
    explicit multi-perspective list of requirements for their designs
    (i.e. what do the clients or customers actually want?). Finally,
    during the visits the students were also invited to make their own
    observations and (first, preliminary) interpretations of the
    changing identities within both projects. This was realized by means
    of self-taken photographs, sketches (e.g. ground plan, different
    rooms and spaces, entrance, circulation, atmosphere and lightening)
    and measurements (e.g. inner surfaces and heights). Once again
    students were stimulated to actually "absorb" and thus understand
    the story of the two public libraries more in-depth by matching the
    received story by the "others" with their own particular spatial
    interest and familiar world of interior architecture.

-   Subsequently, the students were divided into groups of maximum four
    members. Each group received a double assignment: the making of (i)
    a *conceptual* design for the public library project in the city of
    Kortrijk (i.e. focus on the central idea and main features of the
    overall interior design) and (ii) a *practical* design for the
    municipality of Destelbergen (i.e. focus on the operational
    feasibility and details of the interior design). Taken together,
    both interior design assignments reflected and thus checked for the
    competences that gradually had been developed throughout the entire
    bachelor curriculum of interior architecture at the University of
    Antwerp. During this rather intense design process, students were
    free to collect additional information by means of different data
    collection techniques (e.g. photographs, individual interviews,
    policy documents, plans, sketches and observations). As such, the
    students decided mainly themselves how the subsequent awareness
    could or would grow and what kind of emphasis they found desirable
    or preferable to be elaborated into their interior designs. By
    giving them enough freedom to act, the teaching staff wanted to
    generate especially a self-managed exploration process that would
    further trigger their fascination and public library awareness. In
    order to achieve this goal, students received intermediary feedback
    information on a weekly basis from the staff members, emphasizing
    and triggering well-considered and -argumented choices in the
    interior designs "under construction" (e.g. how do these choices
    coincide with the two changing identities?).

-   At the end of July, the design assignments came to an end. The
    results were evaluated by a jury consisting of all staff members
    involved, four internal colleagues and four external representatives
    of the respective projects. As such, the staff members wanted to
    receive extra information on the accuracy and usefulness of the
    elaborated interior designs. Each group of students had to present
    their respective interior designs by means of different
    communication techniques (e.g. plans, renderings, sketches, a
    scale-model, samples of material used and an oral presentation of
    approximately 15 minutes).

When considering the very nature of this assignment in retrospect, we
would like to use the metaphor of "diving into the deep blue sea".
Although this metaphor might not be that self-evident for librarians, it
still is a very useful and relevant metaphor for the teaching staff. In
order to create a fitting interior design, the students had to explore
the associated but for them rather new and complex societal challenges
of the two public libraries involved. They had to inventory expectations
and fascinations, gather in-depth information, observe numerous
variations, and gradually build insights that not only helped them to
(i) understand the challenges themselves but also to (ii) develop
interior design blueprints and to (iii) assess the implications of these
designs on the initial challenges (i.e. do they match?). As such,
students had to collect strange and peculiar "sea-artefacts" and assess
the impact of their "fishing" and exploration activities on the "sea
environment" itself. In short, the bachelor students clearly had to
leave familiar grounds and dive into a new territory, being that of the
sea of changing public libraries.

### The initial images - on *general* and *homogeneous* stories about the sea

To have an idea of the initial images or notions of the bachelor
students on the changing identities of public libraries, the staff
members collected mainly information by means of short informal
discussions, reactions and questions of the students made during the two
lectures, the initiating assignment and the visits to the premises.
After that, the bachelor students began to process the received
information into interior designs so that the initial images changed and
design-triggered images came apparent (see next paragraph).

When considering the features of these first images of public libraries,
the teaching staff uncovered a somewhat two-sided story.

On the one hand, the bachelor students were clearly familiar with the
general concept of the public library in so far that they as a child and
during their leisure time as well as their early school career
frequently visited them (i.e. every week, at least once a month). The
main reason for their visit was the lending of books and the collection
of information (e.g. a school assignment). Nowadays, they still visit
public libraries but mainly to find a quiet, easily accessible space to
study, in particular during their examination periods. This kind of
intensive "study dwelling behavior" is also noticed and registered by
the director of the library of the University of Antwerp. During
information sessions held on different advisory and decision boards of
the University of Antwerp, she emphasizes that students increasingly
make use of the University library despite of the vast amount of social
media devices that enable them to stay "at their digs". Unfortunately,
their dwelling behavior is sometimes considered to be problematic. Thus,
students seem to take a kind of twelve-hours siege including lunch-time
break within the library, so that saturations occur and passing-by
students or other visitors don’t find an empty or free seat anymore. In
short, the public dwelling tends to resemble private residence.
Additionally, there are long queueing-lines before opening time, small
piles of personal garbage left within the library after their departure
and increasing problems in respect to the traditional culture of silence
within the library (e.g. frequent mobile telephone calls within their
"claimed" and "privatized" spot). Informal talks with directors of
public libraries confirm these experiences within their own libraries.
So, and notwithstanding these problems perceived mainly by people
running these libraries and more traditional public library visitors or
users, the bachelor students certainly were familiar with the general
concept of the public library, being - according to them - mainly a
place to find books, information and an easy to claim – but not always
quiet – place to reside. It is interesting that the students themselves
did not really suggest other, new or changing functions or roles,
although they themselves clearly showed a changing behavior within the
library space of the University in comparison to the past (and were also
called attention to this by the library staff and traditional visitors
or users).

On the other hand, the bachelor students of interior architecture did
not really see or experience fundamental "changes" or even different or
alternative changes between public libraries. During the initiating
assignment for instance they mainly looked for modern, impressive and
fascinating buildings and interiors, irrespective, however, of the
associated change in (new) roles of the public library and/or its
societal environment. It was clearly more a matter of spotting trendy
interior designs than associating societal challenges and underlying
policy-wise ambitions. The "link" was not made by them. Similar
impressions occurred when talking about the particular design feature of
digitalization. According to the students "modern" public libraries are
definitely assumed to not go without, but for them the digitalization is
not immediately associated with more general societal challenges and new
functions for public libraries (e.g. that of an information
gate-keeper). Interesting are also the students’ impressions that all
public spaces are changing – read "modernizing" – so that there is no
clear distinction between them. As such, all public spaces want to
support the dwelling and encountering needs of people, and all public
institutions want to contribute to the learning society. Subsequently,
the particular changes of public libraries seem to get lost in this
overall public transition phase. And after all, the "study dwelling
behavior" and the "claiming of collective spots" can nowadays be
realized in almost any public space and interior (incl. fablabs,
creative spaces), which begs the question whether public libraries are
special on that account.

When theorizing these findings, we are inclined to talk about a strong
isomorphic or "similar-form" trend between new functions of public
spaces and institutions, that seem to fade out the particular desired
identities of each public institution on itself, and likewise of public
libraries. This trend presumably also explains why the initial awareness
of the bachelor students is certainly present, but in very general and
homogeneous or one-sided terms.

### The changing images - on very cautious and limited in-depth stories about the sea

One would expect that the intense self-exploration and the repeated
confrontation with additional in-depth information should trigger and
alter the previously described notions of the students. That is
certainly what the teaching staff expected to happen. By hearing, seeing
and doing, the initial awareness of the students would undoubtedly
change in favor of a more detailed, dynamic and differentiated image.
The teaching staff assumed a kind of "wake-up call" during the
realization and finalization of the design assignment. But that is not
what really happened, or - unfortunately - only to a limited extent.

Instead, the teaching staff noticed for instance that mainly the central
concepts as well as the further tailor-made elaborations in function of
the specific target groups, were still formulated in rather general and
even stereotyped ways. The borrowing of books, the associated stock
problems of the collection and the need for attractive reading spots for
visitors remained the major point of attention. Admittedly, these spots
sometimes consisted of interesting, self-designed furniture (e.g.
movable platforms, convertible chair-table constructions), or were
located on original places (e.g. transformed windowsills, separate cubic
constructions that formed additional "rooms" for children to "hide and
seek", double-used staircases). But the overall ideas were only scarcely
focused on the new functions or ambitions of the libraries involved
(e.g. inviting spaces for public encounter, cultural participation and
creativity).

Additionally, most interior designs were too much focused on the desires
and wishes of their designers, being that of a middle class, white male
and female adolescent. It was very difficult for the students to put
themselves in the position of the different target groups involved. As
far as the "Lange Munte" library branch for instance was concerned, it
was striking that sometimes too little attention was paid to the
encounter of very diverse profiles of neighborhood inhabitants.
Admitted, there was a kitchen facility for illiterate migrant women to
have "cooking-encounters", but it was clearly a very trendy, fashionable
and western design of a kitchen. There was also an additionally created
outdoor-square (i.e. created by removing some external walls of the
church or installing interesting out-door staircases), but elderly
people do not really sit on large, windy outdoor staircases, and the
luxurious materials and impressive magnitudes would certainly invite
trendy young urban dwellers living in the center of the city, but not
the elderly and multi-cultural inhabitants of this modest, impoverished
neighborhood. As far as the "house of the child" was concerned, some
choices of color (e.g. only black and white), materials (e.g. a concrete
floor to sit on), furniture (e.g. hanging book shelves approximately one
meter above the floor) were certainly not suitable for babies, toddlers
and children beneath the age of ten. Also, nearly all students had
forgotten to equip the library branch with small, children-sized toilets
in a unique and for them fascinating setting ( e.g. a remark of an
external member of the jury with a lot of experience with young
children: "Going to the toilet is for them really a fascinating
experiment and an activity on itself, especially when it is not at
home").

In view of the previously described remarks, the teaching staff was
therefore somewhat disappointed about the end results. True, some
interior designs actually met the evaluation criteria of (i) a clear and
consistent central concept, (ii) an explicit tailor-made elaboration (in
view of the location, the target groups and the new ambitions involved),
(iii) a well-considered selection of innovative, unique and/or original
interior design aspects (e.g. in materials, circulation or atmosphere),
and (iv) a well-documented and explicitly used set of inspiring
references (e.g. ideas detected and/or observed in already existing and
new public library projects). But most interior designs did not really
meet these expectations, certainly not in a very convincing and
satisfying way. Of course, one can argue that the expectations of the
teaching staff were perhaps too demanding, especially as the external
members of the jury were relatively pleased with the results. But the
teaching staff evaluated the students from a particular perspective,
being that of an intensively trained group of junior experts in interior
design that should be highly susceptible for contextual settings (i.e.
the changing images of public libraries).

### Enablers and disablers - assumed ingredients of a (more) fascinating and professional dive

After the design assignment and given the previously described output,
the teaching staff reflected on the possible causes of these somewhat
surprising results. Why did the initial awareness of the students not
change? Why did they not incorporate the vast amount of in-depth
information received throughout the entire assignment process? What
additional – and presumably overlooked – features of the assignment
could have caused these results? What were the possible enablers or
disablers of this process supported by the teaching staff and the public
libraries involved? What can they both learn in relation to the
triggering of the public library awareness of young people?

Answering these questions is certainly not easy. After all, the
bachelor-proof assignment concerned only one and a rather new assignment
experiment. But answers to these questions would nonetheless be very
interesting, as they generate a first set of inductive insights on how
the awareness of young people on the changing identity of public
libraries can be triggered - or disturbed and prevented? Giving them
information and even involving them in a real-life (short-term) library
project in respect to their own professional fascinations (i.e. their
interest in making interior designs) is clearly not enough. More is
needed. But what can teachers as well as public libraries actually do?
Let us look at some critical reflections and suggestions made by the
teaching staff on this subject:

-   Possibly, a general easy-to-trigger empathy for societal challenges
    of young people has been overestimated, even when it concerns
    challenges that actually happen in their own habitat and where they
    themselves take part in (i.e. they actually visit and use public
    libraries). A related and more fundamental question could therefore
    be: how consciously, detailed and differentiated can young people
    sense and thus comprehend their complex and dynamic living
    environment? Presumably, the information overload – not in the least
    generated by the digital society – can trigger a kind of selective
    perception in order to "survive" and master their
    "information-flooded" lives. This selective perception may perhaps
    explain why the initial images of changing public libraries were
    rather vague and homogeneous, and details seemed to vanish amongst
    the numerous like-wise changes of other public spaces and
    institutions where these young people also reside: what
    differentiates the public library from all the other public places
    that we see, visit and use? And this "protective" selective
    perception may perhaps also explain why additional in-depth
    information did not really alter the initial image substantially,
    even not when the information was collected by the students
    themselves and lasted for six months (but not on a full-time basis).
    And it was surprising how even the numerous interesting references
    of newly designed public libraries that directly related to their
    future vocational interest, were only noticed in "quick glimpses"
    but not taken further into consideration as long-lasting inspiration
    for their proper designs.

In view of the previously described overestimation of an easy-to-trigger
empathy for societal challenges of young people, a more limited but
highly selective and clearly distinctive information flow seems to be
advisable (i.e. what really makes public libraries different?). Such an
information-flow may perhaps better trigger their awareness, certainly
when this would last long enough (more than six months or on a rather
full-time basis?), so that it can break through the protective barriers
of their selective perception.

For public libraries this might imply that quick, overwhelming and
rather general information or marketing campaigns are presumably not
that effective for communicating the new image(s) of public libraries to
young people. These general information-flows can easily be overshadowed
by like-wise initiatives undertaken by other public organizations. Such
overwhelming information overkill presumably wipes out any long-term and
in-depth effect. A more specific and focused information-flow in which
the particular nature of the "new" public libraries is emphasized, may
therefore be preferred.

For teachers working and focusing on the changing images of public
libraries, it might help if *external* library specialists would give
the information in place of the "familiar" teaching staff that
unfortunately is not always seen as experts or specialists in the
subject by the students. As such, the information-flow might not really
be perceived as distinct or different. It also might be a good idea if
more than one clearly distinctive project about the changing identities
of public libraries would be offered. If, for instance, more assignments
or courses within the curriculum on the interior design of new and
changing public libraries would coincide and would use the same
carefully chosen set of information, the selective perception barriers
of the students might perhaps be more easily encountered.

-   Additionally, a general attitude of young people to act independent,
    pro-active, explorative, risk-seeking and critical has been
    overestimated as well. When confronted with a rather *complex*
    societal challenge like that of changing public libraries, young
    people seem to stick very close to their so-called comfort-zone
    presumably in order "not to drown" in the complexity, which is of
    course understandable given their young age and "maturity under
    construction". A related and more fundamental question could
    therefore be: how willing, keen and capable can young people be or
    get to explore their complex and uncertain living environment? This
    comfort-zone reflex may perhaps explain why the students were not
    that creative or innovative and did not do more than formally
    assigned, asked and evaluated by the teaching staff (i.e. marks on
    the bachelor-proof). All staff members noticed that the students
    always looked for the "shortest, safest and easiest way" to design.
    They mostly glimpsed at the safe (because selected by the teaching
    staff and public libraries involved) information, but they rarely
    realized additional, self-planned unsafe (because not really framed)
    observations or interviews with the target groups themselves.
    Additionally, the students focused intensively on the "technical and
    material" requirements of the interior designs of public libraries
    (e.g. needed length of bookshelves, available surface), and not or
    only to a limited extent on the "perceptive and experience-related "
    requirements of public libraries (e.g. evoked fascination, desires).
    Thus, the representatives of the two public libraries involved
    reported repeatedly to the teaching staff that they were not
    contacted (anymore) by the students to give additional information
    on, for instance, the names and coordinates of (local) experts,
    colleagues, neighborhood communities or inhabitants to be contacted
    for an interview or focus-group debate. And when the students were
    asked if they nonetheless had done this, they confirmed also
    repeatedly to the teaching staff that they had not. Some citations:

    -   "Our students do not seem to understand that they certainly need
        to observe both locations and interview the target groups
        involved in order to know precisely what kind of scenography
        they should create by means of their interior designs"

    -   "We assumed that they would certainly explore the public library
        sites by themselves, but this is unfortunately not the case"

    -   "We clearly need to give them explicit orders to do this, and
        even then they seem to be very reluctant to do so, how come?"

    -   "They do not explore the cases intensively although we have
        taught them to do so during the last three years, why is that
        so?"

    -   "Why have they not asked the librarians to join and observe them
        for a couple of days, they had their names and numbers and had
        already met them in person during our organized site visit?"

    -   "Why do we really need to monitor them so closely and nearly
        force them to take more initiative?"

Related to this comfort-zone reflex of the bachelor-students is the
overestimated presence of a critical attitude towards the received
information. The teaching staff was somewhat surprised to find out that
the students automatically took nearly all of the received information
by the public library and all actors involved for granted. They
obviously did not seem to feel the need to check and double-check it. Of
course, "questioning" received information implies that you deliberately
and consciously create a kind of position of discomfort. And also the
subsequent search for "other, contradicting or objecting" information
triggers a feeling of discomfort. Nonetheless, critical attitude is very
essential for making good and fitting interior designs for the social
challenge involved.

For public libraries, the previously described underestimation of the
comfort-zone reflex and the lack of a critical attitude might imply that
more effort should be given to make young people more conscious of the
various user, residing and dwelling facilities within changing public
libraries. They themselves may not be inclined to reflect on this in a
very deliberate way, so they should be gradually and explicitly
triggered and invited to do so (e.g. a step-by-step approach or dialogue
that invites them to see, observe and tell their own story and gradually
explore new opportunities that complement their initial story).
Understanding the "perceptive and experience-related" changes of public
libraries is too complex, uncertain and uncomfortable a situation, to be
thought of as "it will happen spontaneously and in an instance".

For teachers it might help when an intense (compulsory?) participative
observation exercise within a public library could be organized, or a
cooperation with other students that are more familiar with the
discipline of library sciences (i.e. a multidisciplinary approach of the
bachelor-proof assignment). Thus, the comfort-zone of the
interior-design students could be enlarged or at least be stretched out.
Another solution might be a (more) careful, and well-considered ex-ante
(early) consideration of the assignment itself. It was certainly a good
idea to relate the bachelor-proof assignment to two existing or
real-life cases. In this situation, the students did not experience a
high degree of discomfort caused by the abstract and/or virtual nature
of the changing images of public libraries. Perhaps, though, it was not
that interesting to focus (too) much on the technical and material
requirements instead of the perceptive and experience-related
requirements of the public libraries involved. Thus students were given
a "lead" to hide in their comfort-zone, in form of easy to grasp facts
and figures. And maybe it was neither a good idea to give them two
instead of only one public library, as this double information-flow
might have confused them and lead them to stay in their comfort zone.

-   Finally, also the professional copy-cat behavior of young students
    has been underestimated. Students who want to become interior
    architects are not only influenced by their curriculum (and what is
    taught), but also by the attitude and thoughts of the people
    teaching them and certainly of the famous, leading and by the
    teaching staff "staged" professionals in their domain. A related and
    more fundamental question could therefore be: how willing, keen and
    capable can young people be or get to copy the thoughts and design
    behaviors of professional examples? And if this is the case, how can
    their awareness then (also) be triggered by these people or
    "exemplary idols"? This copy-cat behavior may perhaps explain why
    the students did not link the societal challenges explicitly to the
    changing images of public libraries and then to their own (fitting)
    interior designs. In numerous examples of new built public libraries
    selected by the teaching staff and also consulted by the students
    themselves in the initial assignment, students did not find much or
    even no information at all concerning the "link" between the context
    (i.e. societal challenge and new ambitions of public libraries) and
    the specific features of the interior design. Most arguments used by
    the architects and interior architects to explain and account for
    their interior design were based on their personal reflections,
    desires and fascinations. How can we then expect students to behave
    otherwise and actually make this contextual link? Of course, it is a
    prerogative of designers to also be inspired by personal ideas and
    ideals (i.e. "I design this because I want it and find it
    important"), but the challenge may be to also be inspired by the
    societal and contextual environment of these designers. The latter
    is especially important when asked to make a design for a public or
    semi-public space like a public library. After all, the present and
    future users, dwellers, admirers, and actual makers of this public
    space have an equally important prerogative on the design. This
    certainly does not imply that their prerogatives are "more"
    important, but at least that a dialogue and thus the joint creation
    of a (more) contextual sensitive instead of a purely individual
    design is appropriate.

In view of the previously described copy-cat behavior, the explicit use
and in-depth debates on references and examples (i.e. on interesting
public library buildings and the interior architects involved) would be
advisable. Students should be made attentive in how to consult, read and
judge upon these existing interior design references for public
libraries. And judgement should not only be based on the personal view
or idea of an interior architect, but also on judgements made by all
actors involved and thus certainly also by the public libraries
themselves. As such, a multi-perspective evaluation including also
representatives of the public library (i.e. staff, users, dwellers,
policy makers) will enrich and trigger the actual images formed in our
society. Only then interior architecture students and younger people can
actually learn if and how "links" between the changing images and their
interior design features can be accomplished. And presumably only then
their awareness on the changing images of public libraries can be
accordingly shaped and intrinsically absorbed. In short, public
libraries as well as teachers should evaluate and communicate more
explicitly why certain public library buildings and their interiors do
(not) fit certain changes within the images of public libraries.

### Conclusion

By means of a bachelor-proof assignment in interior architecture, we
have gained some interesting insights into the presence and
"involvement–triggered" awareness of the changing identity of Flemish
public libraries by young people. Additional research is certainly
needed to further investigate, confirm and embed these results within a
more robust theoretical framework. But the present inductive insights of
this "experiment" are nonetheless interesting and certainly challenging
for the teaching staff as well as the public libraries involved.

It is clear that an intense and conscious awareness of young people on
the changing images of public libraries is not that self-evident. Images
do exist, but only in rather general, vague and homogeneous terms.
Additionally, similar trends within other public spaces and institutions
seem to overshadow and even fade out the particular or specific features
of these public library images. And involving students in a more active
way (i.e. by means of a proper interior design assignment), can neither
be seen as a water-proof guarantee to trigger their awareness.

Presumably this is due to the rather complex nature of the underlying
triggering process. Reflecting on the outcomes of the assignment and the
displayed behavior of the students, the teaching staff has identified
three possible disablers, being (i) the overestimation of the
susceptibility to complex societal challenges (i.e. it is difficult for
young people to comprehend the complex and dynamic nature of the
changing public libraries in a conscious, detailed and differentiated
way), (ii) the overestimation of the eagerness to leave existing
comfort-zones and explore unknown challenges (i.e. young people are not
automatically willing, keen and capable to explore the complex and
uncertain nature of changing public libraries), and (iii) the
underestimation of (vocational) copy-cat behavior (i.e. young people
copy the design-behavior of interior architects that do not explicitly
refer themselves to the link between the design and the societal
challenges of public libraries). Although a further literature study is
certainly needed to corroborate these reflections, we can already refer
in this conclusion to some interesting publications within the
discipline of interior architecture that make similar reflections. In
particular, there is a growing concern for the not-self-evident
awareness and explicit link of societal challenges to the interior
design of buildings and institutions. However, According to some
examples of interior architecture, the debate is rather new and is
certainly not yet fully supported within the discipline, neither by
practitioners nor by academics (Anderson, Honey, and Dudek, 2007; "A
Global Assessment of the Interiors Discipline," 2011).

To encounter these disablers, different strategies for teachers as well
as public libraries are suggested. In view of the particular reader
profile of this journal, public libraries might for instance avoid
quick, overwhelming and rather general information campaigns that
presumably wipe out any long-term and in-depth awareness effects.
Instead, more specific and focused information-flows in which the
particular nature of the "new" public libraries is emphasized (in
comparison to other public institutions), may therefore be preferred.
Additionally, public libraries should know that young people have to be
confronted gradually and carefully with unknown and uncertain societal
challenges. As such, they should be gradually and explicitly triggered
and invited to reflect on the changing images of public libraries in a
very deliberate and conscious way. And finally it would be interesting
if public libraries should communicate more explicitly their experienced
"fits" and "misfits" of the public library building and its interior in
view of the changing images within the public libraries. Thus, they can
enrich the ongoing debate within the discipline of architecture and
interior architecture, and in particular trigger the awareness of young
people vocationally fascinated by these particular disciplines.
