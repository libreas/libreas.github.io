    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><a href="http://www.librarystudentjournal.org" class="textrot">Library 
              Student Journal (LSJ)</a><span class="text">  is an international 
              Open Access (OA) student journal. We publish essays, book reviews, 
              editorials, and peer-reviewed articles from Library and Information 
              Science (LIS) students worldwide, and encourage active participation 
              from anyone wanting hands-on experience with OA publishing. OA has 
              big implications for the LIS field and it is important that LIS 
              students be familiar with this emerging new model of scholarly communication. 
              </span></p>
            <h3>A Brief History of LSJ </h3>
            
            <p>LSJ was first conceived as a small in-house print journal for students in 
                    the Department of Library and Information Studies at the University 
                    at Buffalo (UB) in Buffalo, New York. The project took on 
                    a national scope when it became apparent from our preliminary 
                    research that LIS student publishing included no large-scale 
                    North American journals&#8212;though attempts had been made 
                    in the past, none were still in existence (most notably, The 
                    Katharine Sharp Review was an early online LIS student journal 
                    and had a lot of success from 1995 to 1999). We eventually 
                    dropped the idea for a print version altogether and embraced 
                    an online-only Open Access model. This shift in thinking caused 
                    us to think internationally rather than focus on North America; 
                    it has since been our goal to have participation from all 
                    areas of the world and we try to encourage the sharing of 
                    ideas and experiences across political boundaries. </span></p>

                </div>
            <p class="text"> Our first call for Editorial Board members in early 
              2006 resulted in a tremendous response from many passionate and 
              enthusiastic LIS students. Any doubts we had that there would be 
              interest in such a journal were quickly forgotten, and since then 
              we have never lacked for submissions, volunteers, and general good 
              will. We now have a 25-member Editorial Board, and dozens of peer-review 
              and book review volunteers from around the world. Every day we hear 
              from students wanting to be involved in one way or another, and 
              it is heartening to see so much interest in student publishing. 
              The submissions we receive are on a very wide variety of LIS topics, 
              but are generally very forward-thinking and attempt to add a new 
              perspective on an old topic or to bring new information to the peer-reviewed 
              literature of the field. </p>
            <p class="text">Email and the widespread use of computers and the 
              internet make it easy to quickly reach readers in places that would 
              have been nearly impossible even a few years ago. A single email 
              announcing a new issue, for instance, might be posted to the JESSE 
              listserv one day and be referenced the next day in blogs from Japan, 
              New Zealand, and Germany the next&#8212;which has made marketing 
              rather easy for us, though we may do worry that we are only reaching 
              those who read blogs and subscribe to listservs. </p>
            <p class="text">We like to think there is a way for all LIS students 
              to participate in LSJ. As authors, editors, proofreaders, reviewers, 
              or even just as readers, we happily welcome participation from enthusiastic 
              LIS students and encourage discussion on topics raised in the &#8220;pages&#8221; 
              of LSJ. We have a monthly poll, an Editors&#8217; blog, a listserv, 
              and a discussion forum for those wanting to further discuss any 
              issues raised by published papers. This field is quickly evolving 
              with new issues emerging all the time. It is important that we share 
              new perspectives and ideas across borders and boundaries. </p>
            <h3>What&#8217;s next?</h3>
             
              <p>As we near graduation&#8212;those of us left from the founding staff, 
              that is&#8212;our attention is focused on finding ways to ensure 
              the long-term survival of LSJ, to give new LIS students a chance 
              to build something greater on the foundation we&#8217;ve laid. LSJ 
              has published three &#8220;issues&#8221; but will henceforth be 
              publishing on a continuous schedule&#8212;we will be releasing papers 
              as soon as they are ready for publication (at a rate of approximately 
              one paper per week) rather than publishing several papers at once 
              a few times a year. This change will accomplish two things. First, 
              it will allow us to publish papers in a more timely manner&#8212;articles 
              on a very current topic will no longer have to wait for the next 
              issue to be made public. Second, by eliminating deadlines the stress 
              on our unpaid, overburdened staff will be drastically lowered&#8212;the 
              importance of which, for the long-term survival of a journal of 
              this type, cannot be overemphasized. </p>
            <p><span class="text">To better deal with a large number of submissions, 
              we will soon be moving to an Open Journal Systems (OJS) journal 
              management system. OJS, developed by the Public Knowledge Project</span> 
              <span class="erklaerung">(</span><a href="http://pkp.sfu.ca/" class="back">http://pkp.sfu.ca/</a><span class="erklaerung">)</span><span class="text">, 
              is extremely popular among Open Access journals for its usability 
              and its price tag (it is open source and thus free). The move will 
              increase our general efficiency and will allow us to more easily 
              track each paper as it moves through the many steps of the peer 
              review and editing process. And it will allow us to take a step 
              towards being truly international.</span></p>
            <p class="text">For our development into a publication that represents 
              the views and concerns of LIS students worldwide, we feel it is 
              important that our editorials staff be open to all LIS students 
              worldwide. As we look to fill positions opened by graduating staff 
              members in the coming months, we will be advertising internationally. 
              We will be accepting applications from those interested in being 
              Editor-in-Chief, Section Editor, Copyeditor, Proofreader, and Web 
              Editor. Members of the current staff, including myself, will continue 
              to act as &#8220;publisher&#8221; for the foreseeable future&#8212;to 
              provide consistency and stability in the coming years we will take 
              care of funding and technical issues, and advertise for open positions 
              as they become available&#8212;but we will be handing over all editing 
              and day-to-day operation.</p>
            <h3>
              Open Access and LIS Student Journals</h3>

              <p>Open Access (OA) is much more than a general notion that information 
              should be widely available&#8212;it is a very specific movement 
              with serious implications for the Library and Information Science 
              (LIS) field, and nobody is in a better position to affect its development, 
              for better or worse, than librarians. Yet most LIS practitioners 
              and faculty have only a vague idea of what OA is, and few fully 
              understand the potential impact this new way of distributing scholarly 
              information might have. </p>
            <p class="text">Two futures now exist. In one, librarians are dismissive 
              of the OA movement, react to it too slowly, and find that their 
              relevance and their budgets have been greatly diminished. In the 
              other, librarians take the initiative to be an active player in 
              the development of OA, work with scholars and publishers to address 
              some of the important new issues it raises, and find themselves 
              in a position of new relevance in the digital age. Which future 
              will happen largely depends on the current LIS student population. 
            </p>
            <p class="text">Current OA LIS student journals have an important 
              role in introducing the concept of OA to future faculty and practitioners, 
              modeling a system of scholarly communication that has a large potential 
              for librarian involvement. The emergence of <em>LIBREAS.Library 
              Ideas</em> in 2005 and LSJ in 2006 has provided LIS students around 
              the world with working models of OA publishing, an important new 
              dimension to the more obvious goal of providing a forum for students 
              to share ideas and showcase their work. </p>
            <p class="text">Many current students will, in the coming years, find 
              themselves in the position to support OA publishing. A young systems 
              librarian at an academic library will be asked if he is willing 
              to install and maintain an OJS system. A new library director will 
              consider a request to dedicate a substantial portion of her limited 
              budget, staff time, and server space to an upstart OA project. A 
              reference librarian will notice a need for better communication 
              of scholarly information in their area of expertise and will consider 
              founding an OA journal. If those young librarians can appreciate 
              the implications of OA, can see the bigger picture and recognize 
              the opportunity, there will be sufficient incentive for most of 
              them to make at least a small investment and for a few of them to 
              make a big investment. </p>
            <p><span class="text">If they do, the future will be brighter for 
              Open Access. If they do, the future will be brighter for librarianship. 
              </span></p>
