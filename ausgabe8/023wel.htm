    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">BibSpider, the publisher of this book, has, within 
              a comparatively short space of time, gained for itself a reputation 
              for producing works on contemporary issues in librarianship with 
              a decided international outlook. It is no surprise then that this, 
              their latest offering, is both bi-lingual (German/English) and comprises 
              contributions from librarians from four different countries &#8211; 
              Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States of America. 
              What is perhaps surprising though is that all the contributors, 
              regardless of their nationality and library background, are generally 
              agreed as far as the main thrust of the argument running throughout 
              the book is concerned, which can be summarised as the urgent need 
              for libraries to be re-invented if they are to occupy a viable and 
              relevant space in society. As one of the contributors writes:</p>
            <p class="text">Are we actually trying to add to the public&#8217;s 
              growing belief that they don&#8217;t need libraries because everything 
              is on the internet? Do we want people to come to the library? Have 
              we stopped believing that the physical library offers a special 
              experience that people need and want?</p>
            <p class="text">Each of the seven contributors to the book, experienced 
              in both academic and public libraries, offer answers to these questions, 
              approaching the subject from different viewpoints. Just as they 
              are agreed upon the causes of the problem, so they seem to be agreed 
              upon ways in which the problem can be tackled, and these ways are 
              not theoretical, they are drawn from practical experience, from 
              surveys of usage, attempts to &#8216;market&#8217; a library service, 
              and, in the case of some of the contributors, through experience 
              as consultants on library planning.</p>

              The idea for the book came about following a conference held in 
              Berlin in 2003 which, in the words of Paul S. Ulrich in his introduction 
              to the book, &#8222;was an attempt to disseminate the experiences 
              New Yorkers had with their New York Public Library following 11 
              September&#8221;. The keynote address at the conference was given 
              by Denise Hibay, Assistant Chief Librarian for Collection Development 
              in the New York Public Library&#8217;s Research Division. That address 
              is reproduced in the book and forms a focal centre for the other 
              contributions. Library use increased considerably in the days following 
              11 September, with the conclusion being drawn that &#8216;the most 
              significant and powerful act of the library was the simplest. And 
              that was to open its doors on the days following the attacks. The 
              library served as a stable and reassuring presence for neighbourhood 
              residents&#8217;.</p>
            <p class="text">Hopefully most librarians will not have to undergo 
              the trauma and tragedy of 11 September and its aftermath, but the 
              message is clear and straightforward, libraries have an important 
              role to play in society and those working in them have a duty to 
              make those libraries accessible to all who want to use them. Whatever 
              type of library is concerned, it should be a place people want to 
              come to, not only to use its wide variety of resources, but to meet 
              and socialise. In the preface to the book we are told that &#8216;the 
              Staatsbibliothek (State Library) in Berlin has become a &#8222;marriage 
              market&#8221; place&#8217;. Then, in the final chapter, it is stated 
              that in the USA &#8222;more than one romance has started in a library&#8221;. 
              Who said libraries were only for fuddy-duddies?</p>
            <p class="text">The greater part of the book looks at ways in which 
              libraries make it difficult for people to use them and offers suggestions 
              as to how this can be overcome. In his chapter Paul S. Ulrich goes 
              as far as suggesting that all newly qualified librarians might benefit 
              from attending a course on how to make a library unusable as a way 
              of getting them to look at the library from the user&#8217;s point 
              of view. Now there is a great idea!</p>
            <p class="text">Marylaine Block devotes a chapter getting back to 
              basics by looking at the need to rethink the model library now that 
              people will be using it less for information because of the Internet. 
              Her message is that librarians should &#8222;start thinking about 
              what society needs more of at this point, that we are uniquely qualified 
              to provide&#8221;, going on to detail what those are. In the following 
              chapter Michael Dewe discusses a number of ways in which the public 
              library can be re-invented &#8222;in a way that will dispel any 
              negative images and broaden its appeal&#8221;. He is as concerned 
              as much with the external setting of the library as organisation 
              within the library itself. </p>
            <p class="text">Myoung Wilson and Farideh Tehrani, librarians at Rutgers 
              University, New Jersey, describe ways in which their service has 
              attempted to market what it has to offer to students, with examples 
              ranging from integrating library instruction with course work (very 
              successful) to adverts in student buses (not so successful). In 
              addition, they provide information analysing results. Their conclusion 
              is that the &#8222;current marketing challenge for academic libraries 
              is to understand the elusive ways that the Net generation of students 
              and faculty use digital and print libraries&#8221;. This is a message 
              librarians in other types of institutions should ponder and act 
              upon.</p>
            <p class="text">Olaf Eigenbrodt sees the library as a mixture of &#8222;living 
              room&#8221; and &#8222;meeting place&#8221;, stressing that &#8222;the 
              space of the library is never a single room, but traditionally a 
              whole range of spaces for different needs&#8221;. He points out 
              also that many librarians, because of the introduction of digital 
              processing, storage and output of texts, feel uncertain about their 
              position, seeing their own future as precarious. Against this, he 
              has the following words of comfort for those worried about digitalisation:</p>
            <p class="text">But the idea that all people would become nerds has 
              been revealed to be nothing more than the wishful thinking of the 
              nerds themselves.</p>
            <p class="text">Like the other contributors to the book, Paul S. Ulrich 
              offers practical advice on how the library can be re-invented, the 
              greater part of his chapter being devoted to ways in which some 
              sections of the population are excluded from using libraries. His 
              conclusion is that librarians &#8222;need to create an environment 
              which is conducive to attracting new and retaining old users. We 
              need to emphasize that we are public places open to all, with something 
              for everyone, that we are sensitive to their needs and are there 
              to provide assistance.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">If what the majority of the writers in this book offer 
              is a challenge, then one chapter gives a vivid description of how 
              one library service was able to rise to that challenge and re-invent 
              itself on a grand scale. This is in the chapter written by Alfred 
              Pfoser, Director of Vienna Public Libraries, in which he provides 
              information on the new main public library in Vienna, opened in 
              April 2003. Following the opening there was, as expected, a large 
              increase in public usage. This has been maintained to date. Surprisingly, 
              in addition to that continued increase at the new main library, 
              there has been a 15 % increase in public usage at branch libraries 
              also. Various factors seem to have contributed to this: location, 
              design of the main building, a doubling of the size of the library 
              stock, staff reorganization together with outsourcing of some activities, 
              marketing through the creation of a strong PR department, enlargement 
              of the computer services department, and providing space and time 
              for continuing education and special events within the library.</p>
            <p><span class="text">As most of the writers in the book are at pains 
              to point out, libraries have to exist under certain restraints, 
              most noticeably those of a financial kind. Not every library service 
              has the opportunity to re-invent itself through the planning and 
              bringing into being of a new building. On the other hand, as this 
              book is at great pains to point out, there are many ways in which 
              a library can be re-invented to bring it more into line with contemporary 
              needs. The ideas and information presented in this book are well-written 
              and clearly presented, and provide more than enough ammunition for 
              those librarians to fire at their governing bodies when trying to 
              obtain permission &#8211; and finance &#8211; to begin the task 
              of re-invention. As such it is strongly recommended. Read it and 
              who knows, you might be able to re-invent yourself and find romance 
              in the library. As this book makes clear, it&#8217;s an international 
              phenomenon.</span><br>
