            <p>Ladies and gentlemen, </span></p>
            <p class="text">First of all, I would like to thank you for the invitation 
              to take part on a discussion with you. I am very honoured that you 
              have invited Denmark as a special guest on this occasion.</p>
            <p><span class="text">I work for the Danish Library Agency<span class="text"><span class="text">[<a name="f1b" id="f1b"></a></span></span></span><a href="#f1" class="back">Fn1</a><span class="text"><span class="text"><span class="text">]</span></span>, 
              an advisory board to the Danish Ministry of Culture. Our job is 
              on the one hand to advise the Ministry on library matters and on 
              the other to support and actively promote the development of Danish 
              libraries. In this connection I have decided to concentrate on the 
              public libraries and their social library work. Perhaps &#8211; 
              and hopefully &#8211; some of it might provide you with a measure 
              of inspiration.</span></p>
            <p class="text">In Denmark we don&#8217;t actually use the concept 
              &#8216;social library work&#8217;. For years we have talked in terms 
              of &#8216;outreach library work&#8217;. This meant functions actually 
              outside the library building, aimed at the service to all who were 
              prevented from visiting the library themselves, for example library 
              service to hospitals, old people&#8217;s homes, prisons, military 
              barracks and &#8216;The library at your doorstep, i.e. service to 
              the old and the handicapped in their own homes. To deal with this 
              aspect we had a special professional group under the Danish Union 
              of Librarians who by tradition has always been a highly professional 
              union.</p>
            <p class="text">The group, however, abolished itself six years ago 
              when it began having difficulty in attracting members, amongst other 
              things because there were no longer as many people within the library 
              field who worked exclusively with this particular area. I was asked 
              to speak on that occasion in the past and recently took another 
              look at what I had then said: I said that our social work should 
              continue to be an important part of library work, but that it was 
              bound to find a new form and that it would to a greater extent become 
              an integrated part of the libraries&#8217; other tasks. New ways 
              had to be tried out and programmes had to be designed to match the 
              needs of different groups. What we at that time could see the contours 
              of was for example:</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="text">&#8226; A new generation of older people with a 
                need for instruction in IT competencies.<br>
                <br>
                &#8226; The need for support for reading stimulation. The Danish 
                situation is that every pupil in four leaving elementary school 
                is not able to read well enough to complete a further education 
                &#8211; including a vocational education. In terms of young people 
                with two languages, the figure is one in two.<br>
                <br>
                &#8226; A particular challenge lies within the area of refugees 
                and immigrants where the library could play an active role in 
                the integration initiatives.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Traditional &#8216;outreach work&#8217; is still operating, 
              and many libraries make an important contribution in this way, but 
              a lot of effort has also gone into the development of new forms 
              of socially directed library work. To a great extent encouraged 
              by government means for development, which we in the Danish Library 
              Agency administrate. Over the past few years we have singled out 
              special action lines and developed programmes for those areas which 
              we find important to strengthen. <br>
              <br>
              In 2006 we furthermore prepared an overall strategy for developments 
              in our libraries. A strategy which we considered necessary for the 
              library in order to live up to its position as a central public 
              institution in a digital age. The strategy seeks to take into account 
              new user habits and the new demands which globalisation imposes 
              on Denmark&#8217;s competitive abilities in an international context. 
              At the present time government and the Folketing (the Danish parliament) 
              prioritise:</p>
            <blockquote> 
                <p class="text">&#8226; Research and Education<br>
                  &#8226; Lifelong learning<br>
                  &#8226; Innovation<br>
                  &#8226; Social enterprises that activate and integrate</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Within all these areas we feel that the library has 
              some very important tasks to attend to.<br>
              I would like to give you some examples of current projects and programmes 
              with a social aim:<br>
              A very concrete area is support for citizens with reading handicaps. 
              The central institution for library service to the blind, The Danish 
              National Library for the Blind , is in the process of reorganising 
              its entire production from analogous to digital technology. Via 
              the portal &#8220;E17&#8221; digital texts and audio books are introduced 
              to the blind and others who because of some handicap are unable 
              to read conventional text. Due to a comparatively liberal Danish 
              copyright legislation on this point, dyslexics also have access 
              to the site. The Danish National Library for the Blind mediates 
              the digital texts directly to the user and cooperates with the public 
              libraries which can provide guidance to the users in how to use 
              the site. Several public libraries also run projects on IT utility 
              programmes, which give the reading handicapped direct access to 
              information that is being read aloud on the net. A completely new 
              project deals with the integration of such IT utility programmes 
              more generally in learning programmes aimed at lifelong learning.</p>
            <p class="text">One of the recommendations in our strategy is: The 
              librarian must leave the library &#8211; and go in search of the 
              user. This can happen in a physical sense or via the net. A small 
              library in the south of Jutland has for example set up library service 
              in a trucker centre in the municipality. Lorry drivers from all 
              over the country, travelling all over Europe, gather together there. 
              They can borrow audio books which they can enjoy listening to on 
              the long journeys. The project has been a major success with completely 
              new experiences for a group who traditionally has not enjoyed a 
              comprehensive education, and who are not the keenest &#8217;culture 
              users&#8217;. A subsequent project is at the moment extending the 
              service to cover the whole country.</p>
            <p class="text">Over the past ten years many public libraries in Denmark 
              have supplied introduction and instruction to various target groups 
              in the application of new technology and information search on the 
              Internet. For example, courses for students in further education, 
              courses for seniors and for immigrants. In connection with the structural 
              reform which took effect at the turn of the year, one common digital 
              access to public service was opened: borger.dk (citizen.dk) which 
              is a cooperation between state, municipalities and regions. As a 
              consequence of the libraries&#8217; obligation to mediate public 
              information and in continuation of the work the libraries are already 
              carrying out in instructing citizens in searching on the net, an 
              agreement on cooperation has been made with the national institution, 
              the Digital Taskforce that further develops the service. The agreement 
              means that the libraries are given an official role as ambassadors 
              and tutors of borger.dk and the self-service solutions associated 
              with it. Acquiring a digital signature, for example, is not entirely 
              simple. The Danish Library Agency organises the cooperation and 
              also finances an appropriate competence development programme for 
              the libraries. All municipalities have joined the programme. The 
              entire enterprise is, of course, meant as a service to all citizens, 
              but in the nature of the case it does have a social dimension, seeing 
              that some sections of the population will need more help than others.</p>
            <p class="text">Under the slogan &#8216;The library &#8211; gateway 
              to the Danish society&#8217; and in cooperation with the State and 
              University Library, the Danish Library Agency has been running a 
              three-year programme with a view to strengthening the libraries&#8217; 
              work with integration of citizens with another ethnic background. 
              The programme received government grants for four regional consultants 
              who were to inspire and coordinate the individual libraries&#8217; 
              work. At the same time the libraries were given the opportunity 
              to apply for financial means for development projects. The Danish 
              Library Agency wanted in this way to offer &#8216;a helping hand&#8217; 
              for the purpose of working out new models for the libraries&#8217; 
              integration efforts, and thereafter the libraries themselves were 
              to finance further developments. The results were so excellent that 
              the Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and Integration Affairs wanted 
              the libraries to develop the programmes even further with new activities. 
              The kind of integration work that took place in the libraries had 
              proved to work really well. A club for young girls in a part of 
              Odense that has a heavy concentration of foreigners became an enormous 
              success. To young girls and women belonging to an ethnic minority 
              the library is one of very few places that they may visit freely. 
              Via club activities the girls have learnt about social and health-related 
              subjects, got help in seeking jobs etc.</p>
            <p class="text">The Ministry of Refugee, Immigration and Integration 
              Affairs and the Ministry of Culture have therefore subsequently 
              made an agreement of cooperation, which will underpin the libraries&#8217; 
              function as hothouses for citizenship and as learning centres and 
              cultural meeting places. The first concrete result of the agreement 
              is a grant of two million DKK towards establishing help with homework 
              in the country&#8217;s libraries. The aim is to help more young 
              people who have to cope with two languages to improve their Danish, 
              so that they may complete an out-of- school education and later 
              a qualifying education. At the same time help with homework encourages 
              a kind of social fellow-feeling that gives an insight into Danish 
              values.</p>
            <p><span class="text">I feel that the examples I have talked about 
              here apply to some of the libraries&#8217; offers with a clear social 
              dimension. Having said that, the library is by nature, with its 
              fundamental emphasis on ensuring free and equal access to information, 
              socially inclusive. We positively know that the library has played 
              a decisive role for many &#8216;pattern breakers&#8217; both among 
              Danes and immigrants.</span></p>
