fellow at Freie Universität Berlin specialized in academic corruption,
including plagiarism, paper mills, and hijacked journals. Originally
trained in international economics, she shifted her focus to
investigating scientific misconduct and its systemic consequences. Since
2013, she has collaborated with Dissernet to expose academic fraud in
Russia and has identified over 1,000 suspicious papers linked to
fraudulent publishing practices. She co-developed the “Retraction Watch
Hijacked Journal Checker” to help researchers detect scam journals. In
recognition of her impact, Nature named her one of ten people who shaped
science in 2024.</p>
