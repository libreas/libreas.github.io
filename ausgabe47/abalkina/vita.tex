is a research fellow at Freie Universit√§t Berlin specialized in academic
corruption, including plagiarism, paper mills, and hijacked journals.

investigating scientific misconduct and its systemic consequences. Since
2013, she has collaborated with Dissernet to expose academic fraud in
Russia and has identified over 1,000 suspicious papers linked to

science in 2024.
