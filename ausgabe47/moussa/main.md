### Introduction

Retractions are a bitter pill, but they are critical to maintaining the
integrity of the scientific record (Joshi & Minirani, 2024). They act as
a corrective mechanism for flawed or fraudulent research. (COPE, 2019;
Boudry et al., 2023; NISO, 2024; Koo & Lin, 2024; Kovacs et al., 2024;
Moussa, 2022a; Moussa, 2022b; Teixeira da Silva, 2022; Yang et al.,
2024). However, when the retraction process itself is marred by errors,
inconsistencies, or procedural failures, it raises concerns about the
reliability of academic publishing (Thorp, 2022; Moussa & Charlton,
2024). This commentary picks up where Moussa and Charlton (2024), in
their recent *Accountability in Research* article, left off and examines
a particularly troubling case: the retraction of an article from the
*Journal of Marketing Research* (JMR).

Launched in 1964, JMR is one of the five publication venues sponsored by
the American Marketing Association (AMA), the marketing discipline's
most powerful academic and professional association. JMR is a top-tier
journal included in the famous-yet-controversial Financial Times' list
of the top 50 business and economics journals[^1] (Moussa, 2021). The
JMR was published by AMA up to October 2018 when Sage publications
started publishing AMA's fleet of journals.[^2]

The JMR article under scrutiny was published online on April 1, 2010. It
was co-authored by Dirk Smeesters, a Belgian-born social psychologist
who served, until June 21, 2012, as a professor of consumer behavior and
society at the Rotterdam School of Management, Erasmus University
Rotterdam (EUR) in the Netherlands. Smeesters became the central figure
in a widely documented research misconduct scandal, first uncovered by
behavioral scientist and whistleblower Uri Simonsohn. Simonsohn
identified suspiciously improbable results in one of Smeesters' papers
and requested the raw data. Two investigations led by EUR revealed that
Smeesters manipulated datasets to produce favorable outcomes, prompting
the retraction of seven articles (Seadle, 2022; Moussa & Charlton, 2024;
Crone & Green, 2025). The report of the first investigation[^3] was
released on June 1^st^, 2012 while the one for the follow-up
investigation[^4] was made public on March 5^th^, 2014, explicitly
recommended the retraction of the JMR article.

### The long-awaited retraction notice

On December 1^st^, 2022, AMA's JMR finally issued a retraction notice
for Smeesters' fraudulent article. Details about this retraction notice
are provided in Table 1.

table: Table 1. Retraction notice for Smeesters' fraudulent JMR article

### A vague claim about a previous retraction

A first troubling issue is the retraction notice's vague claim that a
retraction for Smeesters' article "was made public in 2014" without
specifying where. Was the retraction posted on JMR's website, or was it
formally published in one of its volumes? If it was merely posted
online, this would deviate from standard practice, which requires a
formal retraction notice (Xu & Hu, 2023). If it was officially
published, the 2022 notice should provide precise details --- volume,
issue, and page numbers --- to ensure proper documentation and
accountability (Bakker et al., 2024). Such ambiguity undermines
transparency and raises questions about the integrity of the retraction
process.

### Institutional misidentification

More troubling is the fact that the retraction notice erroneously
attributes the investigation to Tilburg University. The correct
institution responsible for investigating Dirk Smeesters' research
misconduct was EUR. Given the weight that institutional investigations
carry in cases of research misconduct, naming the wrong university
introduces serious concerns about editorial diligence and
accountability. This mistake is not a minor clerical error; it
misdirects responsibility and potentially damages the reputation of an
uninvolved institution.

If the first retraction notice was indeed published on March 19, 2014,
and the 2022 notice for the same article contains this error, it is
reasonable to question whether the original "lost" notice also
misidentified the institution.

Such an error also raises concerns about the process that retraction
notices undergo. Journals, particularly those with an "elite" status,
have a duty to ensure accuracy in their official statements. If
fundamental details such as institutional involvement are incorrect, how
can readers trust that the retraction process was conducted rigorously?
This case exemplifies why retraction notices should be subject to the
same scrutiny as published research (Xu et al., 2023; Tang, 2024).

### Clerical error or editorial negligence

According to the retraction notice, Smeesters' JMR article was
originally retracted in 2014, yet it did not appear in Sage
Publications' scholarly record until late 2022. This negligence ---
whether due to flawed record-keeping or a breakdown in the transition
between publishers --- raises serious concerns about the reliability of
academic documentation. For context, Smeesters' article was the first
ever retracted by JMR. Failing to communicate this lone retraction
notice to the new publisher is not just an oversight---it is a troubling
lapse in accountability. As a result, for over four years, a fraudulent
article remained publicly accessible as legitimate, persisting through
JMR's transition to Sage in October 2018. During this time, it continued
to be viewed, downloaded (after paying a fee), read, and cited,
reinforcing its false legitimacy until its retraction notice was finally
issued on December 1^st^, 2022.

A striking consequence of this negligence is that a recent JMR article,
published online on August 1, 2023 (see
[https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437231194950](https://doi.org/10.1177/00222437231194950)),
cites Smeesters' JMR paper as a legitimate source in its limitations and
future research section---without acknowledging its fraudulent
nature/retracted status. Hence, JMR cited its own retracted article
despite officially retracting it "twice".

### No apology

The retraction notice notably lacks any apology to JMR's readership ---
a glaring omission that raises serious ethical concerns. Readers,
researchers, and institutions relied on this article as a legitimate
contribution to the field, potentially shaping their own work based on
fraudulent findings. A formal acknowledgment of this failure, along with
an apology, would have been the bare minimum in maintaining trust and
accountability in academic publishing.

### Conclusion

The case of Smeesters' JMR article exemplifies a concerning failure in
the retraction process (Thorp, 2022), allowing a fraudulent article to
remain publicly available and influential for several years. The
retraction was lost, delayed, poorly documented, and full of errors,
jeopardizing the integrity of academic publishing. The lack of an
apology raises questions about editorial responsibility and
accountability (see Meyer, 2015). If retractions are handled
incorrectly, how can scholars trust the scholarly record? This is more
than just an oversight; it is a stark reminder of the systemic flaws
that allow misinformation to thrive unchecked in environments intended
to protect research integrity. The AMA, JMR, and Sage must immediately
correct this retraction notice to ensure that it is both accurate and
comprehensive. Anything less reduces transparency and accountability in
the retraction process.
