    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h3>Isn&#8217;t Anthropology a Social Science? </h3>
            <p> <span class="text">Before examining the possibility of Open Access 
              (OA) in anthropology, the question of whether an essay on anthropology 
              belongs in the Humanities special issue of LIBREAS is, quite honestly, 
              itself up for debate. Individual researchers in anthropology, cultural 
              studies and ethnography find themselves - in terms of theory and 
              method - somewhere along a triangular plane between the natural 
              sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. Depending on the 
              university, anthropologists can find themselves in a department 
              affiliated in any of those three disciplines. The anthropologist 
              Clifford Geertz wrote that </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="zitat">&#8220;ethnographies tend to look at least as much 
                like romances as they do like lab reports (but as with [a] mule, 
                not really like either [a horse or a donkey]).&#8221; (Geertz, 
                1988)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span class="text"> By this, he means that the research is data-rich 
              and empirically-based and in that way pulls the discipline towards 
              social sciences and natural sciences, but the interpretation of 
              the data can go in many directions, including the literary and poetic. 
              For the sake of this article, I will consider it under the umbrella 
              of the humanities, not least because of the preferred modes of publication, 
              i.e. monographs, in the discipline.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> Why a librarian should be writing about anthropology 
              is another question to address, since anthropologists are much better 
              spokespeople for their own field, especially as regards to how they 
              shall and should communicate. As a by-product of my reading on the 
              theories and methods of ethnography for my research on library service 
              design, it struck me that the challenges and opportunities that 
              OA offers for anthropology are very much tied up in questions of 
              ethics in a way that might not be immediately clear to those of 
              us working in the library. Because the audience for this article 
              is librarians and others who hope to design and encourage open access, 
              I write this article to shed light on ways in which we can implement 
              technology that will help anthropologists do their work more efficiently 
              and safely (in terms of data preservation), as well as to offer 
              them exciting new possibilities which are sensitive to their particular 
              ethical concerns. A more thorough examination of the digital scholarship 
              in anthropology is Owen Wiltshire&#8217;s thesis-in-progress, about 
              which he is blogging at 'Another Anthro Blog&#8217; (Wiltshire, 
              2009) or Chris Kelty&#8217;s thoughts on the conjunction of open 
              access and anthropology (Golub et al., 2009; Kelty, 2008). Another 
              useful source on open access/open source is a seven-way conversation 
              between anthropologists, which has been published first in the journal 
              Cultural Anthropology and also as a blog, designed to continue the 
              conversation (Kelty et al., 2008). </span></p>

            <h3>If Malinowski had been a Blogger</h3>
            
            <p><span class="text">Branislaw Malinowski, a European-born anthropologist, 
              is considered by many to be the father of contemporary anthropological 
              field work. His approach to data collection on the cultures that 
              he studied was participant observation, whereby he took part, for 
              long periods of time, in the lives of the people that he wished 
              to study. This methodological approach has, in many ways, become 
              synonymous with the discipline of anthropology.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> After he died suddenly from a heart attack 
              in 1942, a diary was found in his office, which documented his personal 
              experiences during his field research. His wife at the time, Valetta 
              Malinowska, along with a colleague, translated from the Polish and 
              published his diary, entitling it A Diary in the Strict Sense of 
              the Term, even though Malinowski himself almost certainly never 
              intended it to be made public. This decision to make public his 
              private writings was and remains for many, a controversial one. 
              The diary describes - in often painful detail - the loneliness of 
              field research, Malinowski&#8217;s sexual and emotional feelings, 
              unflattering portraits of his social world and peers, harsh remarks 
              about his study population, and his frequent self-medication for 
              a variety of ailments, many of which seem to be illusory. It could 
              be argued that much of the observation is unuseful as a data source. 
              At the same time, it offers valuable insight into the inner intellectual 
              world of an important ethnographer and paints a fuller picture of 
              that which 'voices' his data and interpretation, which gives readers 
              another tool with which to judge the validity of his research.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> A diary or personal field notes can be valuable 
              records of qualitative data. Diary notes can be crucial tools for 
              keeping track of ways of doing things, of the decisions that a researcher 
              makes about what methods were chosen and on what basis, and also 
              how they were implemented, and of outcomes or problems. Logs and 
              diaries also keep track of what happened through time in the field 
              as well as daily developments in theory and managing to-do lists. 
              Ultimately they can also serve as a record of data upon which others 
              can gauge objectivity and work towards reproducibility (in the experimental 
              sense) and openness. (DeWalt and DeWalt, 2002; Fetterman, 1998) 
              </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><span class="zitat">&#8220;At least since the 1960s, most sociological 
                ethnographers have advocated including accounts of personal feelings 
                and emotional reactions in core field notes accounts, sometimes 
                only peripherally in descriptions of ones own methodological doings, 
                sometimes as an exclusive core component of the ethnographic project.&#8221; 
                (Emerson et al., 2001) </span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span class="text"> And so let us consider what would have happened 
              if Malinowski were a young field worker today and had chosen to 
              blog his research, or perhaps that Malinowski had been able to use 
              the medium of the blog during his time with the Trobriand Islanders 
              in the early part of the 20th century. Without getting overly embroiled 
              in the question of what anthropology would look like without Malinowski&#8217;s 
              influence (ouch, my brain hurts), consider the implications of having 
              had real-time, freely-available access to Malinowski&#8217;s journal 
              entries. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">On the plus side, had Malinowski blogged his 
              work, it would have definitely given access to his journal, which 
              gives us insight into his published research, without having to 
              rely on the whims of executors or the sadly haphazard state of most 
              manuscript collections, even if they do manage to find their way 
              into a safe archive. It could have also given some of his colleagues 
              and, perhaps more importantly, some of the people who he was studying, 
              the chance to comment on his insights, his plans and his primary 
              analysis (assuming, however, that his study population and colleagues 
              could understand Polish, the language of the journal). An active 
              audience who commented and encouraged him could have perhaps cut 
              down on his loneliness and sense of isolation. Perhaps a reader 
              who was a nurse could have given him better tips on pain management, 
              and gently suggested he hold off injecting so much arsenic.<br>
              On the down side, it is a given that he would have written much 
              differently if the medium were public than he did in a book meant 
              to be private and it&#8217;s impossible to say whether that would 
              have been a positive or negative. The fact that the insights that 
              we have into his work and his life would have been completely different 
              in a closed medium is enough to cause one to reflect on whether 
              blogging ones diary from the field is always a good idea. Fieldnotes, 
              of which diaries are just one part, are also meant not to be published 
              and the thought that these jottings and scribblings and half-thoughts 
              might someday turn out to be published may put undue strain on the 
              field notes and compromise their quality and their completeness. 
              At the same time, the realization that people are going to be reading 
              field notes may force a researcher to write better ones.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> I present Malinowski&#8217;s example, of course, 
              in a spirit of fun rather than that of true possibility. But the 
              mental exercise allows us to play with a range of issues that anthropologists 
              confront when considering taking advantage of Web 2.0 tools and 
              OA (Open Access), such as whether it is OK to 'publish' fieldnotes 
              and whether writing them for the public will compromise them; or 
              how to balance privacy with transparency.</p>
              
              <p>Some researchers are indeed already blogging from the field, such 
              as the aforementioned Owen Wiltshire, whose interest is in culture 
              in the digital environment. Another example is Christine Folch, 
              whose research is on 'political culture and national identity at 
              Paraguay&#8217;s Triple Frontera' and whose blog 'Defringing Latin 
              America&#8217; mixes photography, video, some analysis and a journal-style 
              description of her work in Paraguay (Folch, 2009). Both Owen Wiltshire 
              and the blog, 'Savage Minds' (Golub et al., 2009) have extensive 
              blogrolls which list upwards of fifty anthropologically oriented 
              blogs, many of which have several authors. So it&#8217;s safe to 
              say that many anthropologists are taking the opportunity to blog; 
              arguably communicating with a wider public than ever before possible. 
              The technology (free to the reader with an internet connection) 
              lowers the economic and effort barrier involved with toll-access 
              journals and books, but another important aspect of blogging is 
              the accessibility of the language used in writing them, which allows 
              a wider range of people to understand them. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Perhaps the most well-known and widely-read 
              anthropology blog is the collective blog, 'Savage Minds' (Golub 
              et al., 2009). The blog hosts lively and high-level scholarly discussions 
              as well as reporting on news of interest to ethnographers. Its group 
              on Facebook, a social networking site, is nearing 1,000 participants. 
              The Savage Minds writers are a group of about 10 people, whose names 
              tend to recur throughout the anthropology blogosphere. Many of them 
              write other anthropology blogs. This style of blog - hosting debate 
              on issues of scholarly interest, relevant news, links to other scholars 
              and announcements - is popular and has fit seamlessly into the anthropology 
              world. Whether the field notes blog becomes similarly common and 
              useful is not yet certain.</span></p>
            <h3>Anthropological Ethics and Open Access</h3>
            <p> <span class="text">Ethics resurface at every stage of anthropological 
              research, not just during the design phase or when a researcher 
              hands out a release form. It&#8217;s undesirable, if not impossible, 
              to separate ethics from what is practical or desirable in anthropology. 
              They guide what type of research to plan and what type of data will 
              be gathered, as well as how and what to analyze, and the voice with 
              which one writes. Most importantly for our purposes, they shape 
              how, when and where to communicate the results of the research and 
              offer the most compelling arguments for (and also against) OA in 
              anthropology.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> The Code of Ethics for the American Association 
              of Anthropology begins its list of research ethics with the statement 
              </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p><span class="zitat">&#8220;Anthropological researchers have primary 
                ethical obligations to the people, species, and materials they 
                study and to the people with whom they work. These obligations 
                can supersede the goal of seeking new knowledge, and can lead 
                to decisions not to undertake or to discontinue a research project 
                when the primary obligation conflicts with other responsibilities, 
                such as those owed to sponsors or clients.&#8221; (American Anthropological 
                Association, 1998)</span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span class="text"> Part of this obligation to the people studied 
              is to share the research with them. Since the 1970s and 1980s, it&#8217;s 
              been generally accepted in anthropology that the traditional power 
              dynamic of researcher and research subject results in assessments 
              of the culture studied that are one-dimensional at best and false 
              at worst. There is a recognition that anthropology has colonialist 
              roots that run deep and that researchers must make an effort towards 
              empowering the subject to become a research collaborator rather 
              than a research subject. There is an aim to represent the world 
              of the culture in all its fullness, to use 'thick description' (Geertz, 
              1973), and also to allow the voice of the study population to describe 
              itself.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> This obligation to the study population is 
              part of a critical question: namely, to whom does anthropological 
              research belong? Does it belong to the scholar who created it, the 
              person who funds it, the scholarly discipline, or to the culture 
              that is studied? According to the ethical codes, it should belong 
              to the people whose culture is described. The fact that, because 
              of generally-accepted scholarly practice, a large share of that 
              knowledge is locked up in expensive books and difficult-to-find 
              journal articles violates one of the foremost principles of anthropology.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> One way to remedy the power imbalance in anthropology 
              is by sharing information in ways that people can read and understand. 
              A researcher may be encouraged to share research findings with a 
              community by sending a copy of a book, a report, or an article but 
              also by making a formal presentation or in casual conversation with 
              members of the community. The perils of 'one-off' information sessions 
              and easily-lost papers are many. In order to make sure that information 
              is truly shared, it must be there when a reader wants it. People 
              will come to information and understand it when there is a compelling 
              need or the time is otherwise right. Making data OA - providing 
              an enhanced security for archiving, access, metadata, reuse, duplication, 
              citation - grants a higher chance that the data will be available 
              to a reader regardless of when s/he decides to go searching for 
              it. There is, of course, the obvious caveat that those without computer 
              access will have no better chance of accessing digital objects than 
              they will the odd book or journal article, though I argue that chances 
              must be higher if the barriers are lower and there are more opportunities 
              available.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">A second extremely important ethical consideration 
              that is true for all scholars, but most importantly for those who 
              use human subjects, is the responsibility for making sure that the 
              research they do will be useful to future science and that you are 
              not wasting the time and effort given to you by the population that 
              you are studying. Allowing for a copyright license that gives full 
              credit to the researcher but that allows for the work to be used 
              easily for teaching and remixing and future scholarship works towards 
              fulfilling that promise.</span></p>
            <h3>Open Data</h3>
            <p><span class="text"> Regardless of how the ethnographic final product 
              is presented, its quality is judged by its believability, or whether 
              the reader finds the data and its interpretation convincing. For 
              this reason, having data without interpretation and context is frequently 
              unuseful and, in many cases, unethical. It can also run the risk 
              of compromising the quality of research. For these reasons, arguments 
              for open data, such as those put forward by Peter Murray-Rust in 
              support of open data for crystallography (and which make sense in 
              that field), are difficult to apply consistently to anthropological 
              data. At the same time, open data in certain situations has the 
              possibility to make anthropological data richer and true to the 
              cultures they represent.</p>

              <p>The question of whether one should give access to primary field 
              research data has been long debated in anthropology, archaeology 
              and ethnography. Many researchers have been reluctant to give access 
              to their primary data because it might compromise site integrity, 
              research-subject privacy, and also because primary data taken out 
              of context can be misleading. Sometimes researchers discover knowledge 
              in the field that it is inappropriate to share openly. Paper-based 
              field notes can often be found in library archives but access to 
              them may be controlled. As in the case of Malinowski&#8217;s diary, 
              the way in which field notes are written could be greatly altered 
              if the researcher knows that they will be published. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Certain types of data (i.e. those which would 
              not result in breaching the ethics described above) would greatly 
              benefit from OA, however. An example of the type of data which may 
              benefit from OA are films made by an ethnographer in the 1920s, 
              for example, which show the daily work routines in a Native American 
              tribe which has since ceased doing that type of work. These films 
              might be just as, if not more useful to researchers in the future 
              than the book which was written based on them depending on the quality 
              of the published work. Though all video and photos are taken from 
              a specific viewpoint and exclude as much as they include, they can 
              offer rich data to future researchers.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> Team-based, data-intensive research involving 
              objects require huge databases and can surely benefit from being 
              digitally networked especially where collaborative data tagging 
              or analysis is possible. There are also possibilities for crunching 
              that data using the help of distributed computers, similar to the 
              Seti@Home project, which harnesses the power of the distributed 
              computers of volunteers to analyze automatically radio signals from 
              space. More data doesn&#8217;t necessary equal more quality in anthropology 
              but where more data is called for and where it can be automatically 
              analyzed or analyzed by many minds rather than a single researcher, 
              this type of distributed data analysis with open data is very promising.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text"> And smaller projects can also benefit from 
              the openness provided by so-called Web 2.0 tools. Data collected 
              on video can be uploaded to YouTube and photographs to Flickr for 
              sharing both with research colleagues around the world and also 
              with the populations studied. Mapping programs could be used to 
              create personal cartographies, whereby the persons studied can tag 
              places with descriptors or provide information on significance. 
              For an ethnographer studying trade patterns in a community or another 
              looking at school children&#8217;s routes to school, such maps could 
              be an innovative way of gathering data in a visual, collaborative 
              fashion and turning the research collaborator into research subject. 
              These services are low-barrier, low- or no-cost for those with an 
              internet connection. Kimberly Christen describes the power that 
              these tools have to do anthropology more ethically and to make research 
              more rich: </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="zitat">&#8220;the Free Software movement demonstrated 
                the power of collaboration. ... These may not immediately seem 
                like tools that have altered anthropology. But think about the 
                idea of uploading your photos from a field site, tagging them, 
                mapping them on Google maps and then allowing others - a range 
                of others - to comment on them. It shifts the way that anthropologists 
                process information, manage data, form arguments, and circulate 
                the materials that they have collected in the field. Not only 
                that, most such sites allow users to define which groups can see 
                what - to define the publics with which they engage. Eric Kansa's 
                project for archaeologists, Open Context (<a href="http://www.opencontext.org" class="back">www.opencontext.org</a>), 
                is an excellent example&#8221; (Kelty et al., 2008) </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span class="text">These web-based services also allow a more data-intensive 
              study because the data are collected by the research subject, rather 
              than the researcher alone. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Because of this complexity regarding how open 
              to be with data, Christen also argues for continuum of openness, 
              rather than a full call to openness (Kelty et al., 2008). She is 
              a co-creator of Mukurtu (</span><a href="http://www.mukurtuarchive.org" target="_blank" class="back">www.mukurtuarchive.org</a><span class="text">), 
              a digital library with communal tagging features, designed around 
              a cultures way of organizing its heritage. It&#8217;s not open access, 
              but access is controlled along a continuum from private to public. 
              She describes the continuum as using 'Warumungu cultural protocols 
              to facilitate access to content' (Kelty et al., 2008). By this she 
              means that the amount of access that a user is granted to the content 
              of the digital library is dictated by already-existing cultural 
              norms. Access is controlled by a login and password. This project 
              shows the sensitivity to ethics and cultural diversity that anthropologists 
              must employ when deciding how technology can assist their project.</span></p>
            <h3>Green and Gold</h3>
            <p> <span class="text">Green or gold open access, whereby an author 
              posts a copy of an article to a data-repository or publishes in 
              an open access journal, may also prove problematic in a fractured 
              field where book-length publication is the highest standard of publishing. 
              The final product of ethnographic research could be presented as 
              a report for a school (in the case of applied anthropology) or the 
              interpretation of a culture could be performed as a dance. Most 
              frequently, however, the interpretation is written and presented 
              in a book. </span></p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="zitat">&#8220;Anthropology is primarily a 'book discipline,' 
                meaning that faculty must write books, at least one 'great' book 
                for tenure, and another book to be promoted to full professor, 
                or as one administrator put it: &quot;Anthro is just sort of irreconcilably 
                book fetish-ized... This is a book discipline. You can have great 
                articles, you hit a ceiling, potentially very low, if you don't 
                have a book, and the book has to be significant, it has to get 
                reviewed in the right places.&quot;&#8221; (King et al., 2006)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span class="text">When designing outlets for green and gold OA, 
              prestige should be emphasized. A book must be published by a good 
              press and it must be well reviewed in the right places in order 
              to be acceptable in anthropology and peer review is crucial for 
              creating quality scholarship (Kelty et al., 2008; King et al., 2006). 
              Thus, whatever digital services are designed to encourage green 
              and gold open access must maintain or perhaps even strengthen the 
              review process. In many ways, anthropology is a conservative, stable 
              discipline. When designing service, it may be good to promote the 
              library&#8217;s stability for long-term access and legitimacy for 
              conferring status.<br>
              An interesting and successful approach to green OA book publishing 
              is Chris Kelty&#8217;s book Two Bits, which he has turned into a 
              website and a community for discussing his ideas on open source 
              software and culture. By creating this hub, he gets immediate feedback, 
              the scholarship is constantly being reused and refined and publicly 
              debated and he argues that he has sold many more copies of the print 
              book than he would have without the site. He points out too that 
              publishing books with a web presence also allows for volunteer translation, 
              which is always a challenge in anthropology. Open access allows 
              for volunteer translations, which if not always a professional quality, 
              still vastly improves a book&#8217;s reach. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">Though the discipline is dominated by book publishing, 
              journals still do play a role in anthropology, and gold OA is an 
              option. The Directory of Open Access Journals lists 53 OA titles 
              in anthropology (incidentally, as Maximilian C. Foote points out 
              on his blog, Open Anthropology, most of these titles are published 
              outside of North America). The journal, Cultural Analysis, based 
              at the University of California, Berkeley, was recognized as the 
              most excellent OA journal by Savage Minds in their awards ceremony 
              of 2008. As things stand, however, the 'best' journals in the field 
              are coming from professional societies, none of which allow open 
              access. In fact, in a blow to open access advocates, the American 
              Anthropological Association (AAA) which is the publisher of 23 important 
              journals, decided in 2007 to switch publishers, moving from University 
              of California Press to Wiley-Blackwell, a private publisher offering 
              on a for-profit basis. The reasons for the move are many, but it 
              is a move decisively away from open access. Steps have been made 
              towards OA, such as an open backfile to articles older than 35 years 
              but the publisher and the society have not yet come to recognize 
              gold OA as an option for their journals. </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">The move to Wiley has also affected AnthroSource, 
              which was meant to be a creative online space sponsored by the AAA 
              with a discipline-specific digital repository for articles as well 
              as for grey literature and raw data. With the move to Wiley, access 
              to it has become a benefit of membership or subscription-based. 
              Though many researchers protested this move, many have moved on 
              and some, such as Alex Golub have decided that perhaps it&#8217;s 
              for the best if communication and data-sharing are not under the 
              auspice of the AAA after all (Kelty et al., 2008). Golub runs an 
              anthropology-specific digital repository at the University of Hawai&#8217;i 
              (manao.manoa.hawaii.edu). Built on the e-prints platform, it has 
              been in process since 2007 and currently hosts about 100 articles 
              published over the course of the past 200 years. <br>
              In the same way that open data can bring anthropologists closer 
              to the ethical obligation of involving the communities they study, 
              Jason Baird Jackson points out that green and gold OA can also be 
              significant in this regard: </span></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p> <span class="zitat">&#8220;Indeed, Open Access has special moral 
                relevance for anthropology and related disciplines because we 
                have 'source communities' that we are responsible to;... A gold 
                Open Access journal or a robust repository effort would get much 
                closer to solving the 'obligation to those we study' problem.&#8221; 
                (Kelty et al., 2008) </span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <h3>Conclusions</h3>
            <p> <span class="text">Anthropological research is a heterogeneous 
              affair and it may prove difficult to find a universal way to encourage 
              open access in the field. The obligation to the study population 
              is a convincing argument for OA, as is the possibility for a richer, 
              more collaborative work environment between researcher and study 
              population. Openness and transparency are of great concern and the 
              argument against clandestine anthropology (which has been used by 
              governments to subdue populations or wage war, would be another 
              great argument for OA.<br>
              When designing repositories for qualitative, anthropological data, 
              there must be ample space for metadata. There must also be the possibility 
              of controlling access. 'Open' might have to be understood to exist 
              along a continuum and the metadata and design may need to be flexible, 
              in order to best reflect cultural norms. Privacy is a serious concern 
              from an ethical standpoint as well as a research-integrity standpoint. 
              </span></p>
            <p><span class="text">As the anthropologists discuss in interviews 
              conducted at University of California, Berkeley in 2006, speed of 
              publication is not as much of a concern to them, though they appreciated 
              the speed by which books could be reviewed in an online medium (King 
              et al., 2006). They have, rather, the perception that there is too 
              much information to be weighed carefully and that perhaps too much 
              is published already. Though it&#8217;s unlikely that any researcher 
              is pleased by the long wait between manuscript submission and publication, 
              making the appeal for open access on the grounds that it allows 
              more work to be published quickly and not squelched by over-zealous 
              peer review will not necessarily be helpful when promoting OA to 
              anthropologists.<br>
              When designing and encouraging open access, we should make sure 
              that the services we design fit with the theory, method and practice 
              of our researcher patrons. There will be contradictions in the demands 
              of researchers in different disciplines and perhaps even within 
              disciplines. In order to create services that really work, we must 
              make them flexible and responsive. </span> </p>
