    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h3>1 Introduction</h3>
            <p class="text">This lecture is based on a pun, or rather on a linguistic 
              ambiguity. The word &#8217;work&#8217; in English can mean both 
              an intellectual product such as a book or journal, or even data 
              from a scientific experiment. Work can also mean tasks or jobs such 
              as those that librarians have today. This lecture involves vanishing 
              acts for both. </p>
            <p class="text">Why have I chosen to speak in English? There are two 
              reasons. The personal one is that English is my mother tongue and 
              an important lecture ought not suffer from an imperfect accent and 
              flawed grammar. The more scholarly reason is that, for better or 
              for worse, English has become the dominant scholarly language in 
              the world of library and information science (LIS). Works in English 
              are read worldwide. Works in German are read in Germany, Austria, 
              and Switzerland.</p>
            <h3>2 The Research Question</h3>
            <p class="text"> Humboldt Universit&auml;t zu Berlin invited me here 
              to transform the Institut f&uuml;r Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft 
              into an internationally competitive I-School like the School of 
              Information at the University of Michigan or the Graduate School 
              of Library and Information Science at the University of Illinois. 
              Part of this effort involves persuading our students to follow international 
              scholarly standards, such as offering a clear research question, 
              an explicit and acceptable research method, and a literature discussion 
              that puts their topic into the context of current scholarly discourse. 
              My students will rightly and properly complain if I do not follow 
              my own standards. My research question looks at the reason why I 
              was brought here and what I hope to do. Specifically the question 
              is what transformations have taken place in the LIS field that persuaded 
              the university to hire me and what consequences do they have for 
              practice, teaching, and research. The answer interrelates the two 
              meanings of the word &#8217;work&#8217;, partly because fears about 
              both jobs vanishing and digital documents vanishing grow from the 
              set of transformations that have been taking place over the last 
              thirty years.</p>
            <h3>3 The Research Method</h3>

            <p class="text"> My academic training was as an historian, but historians 
              (at least in the US) are notoriously methodologically eclectic and 
              I realized sometime not long after finishing my dissertation that 
              I was in fact intellectually more akin to the cultural anthropologists 
              who had so strongly influenced my own Doktorvater. Within academic 
              anthropology I am essentially a follower of Clifford Geertz. Anthropology 
              is an empirical discipline, but the data tend to be impressionistic 
              rather than concrete. Geertz was well aware of this problem and 
              addressed the problem of persuasion in a number of his works. For 
              him the solution was essentially literary. He argues that it was 
              neither &#8221;a factual look or an air of conceptual elegance&#8221; 
              that mattered, but rather persuading readers of having truly &#8221;been 
              there.&#8221; (Geertz 1988) Cultural anthropologists are not novelists, 
              of course, or merely academic journalists. How people use language 
              matters greatly, particularly the linguistic distinction made by 
              Ferdinand Saussure between the signifier and the signified. Such 
              differences between word and meaning offer an empirical basis for 
              recognizing social groupings, particularly within studies of contemporary 
              cultures.</p>
            <p class="text"> My research method has been, in effect, to live as 
              a native among the tribe of librarians for the last thirty years 
              without quite losing my perspective as an observer. This is hoary 
              practice for ethnographers when it comes to exotic societies and 
              it is increasingly common for ethnographers to observe their own 
              cultures. Corporations in fact hire ethnographers today to help 
              with a variety of external tasks (such as understanding their customers) 
              and internal tasks (such as communicating between programmers and 
              business operations). Libraries in the US hire anthropologists as 
              well, as the well-received study by Nancy Foster and Susan Gibbons 
              shows. (Foster &amp; Gibbons 2007) The lab-books for anthropologists 
              are the notes they make based on their observations. Today these 
              are not always written notes. They can be pictures, videos, voice 
              recordings. Occasionally there are circumstances where notes cannot 
              be made immediately, perhaps because the observer is too deeply 
              involved in the event itself. Memory is one of the most treacherous 
              (and most common) forms of note taking. Nonetheless it plays a key 
              role in the selection of the information. Data plays a role where 
              possible, and anthropologists of contemporary societies generally 
              cite statistics and similar evidence. Nonetheless, as Geertz says, 
              proof in anthropology is more than an assemblage of data.</p>
            <p class="text">Footnotes help, verbatim texts help even more, details 
              impress, numbers normally carry the day. But in Anthropology anyway 
              they remain somehow ancillary: necessary of course, but insufficient, 
              not quite to the point. The problem &#8211; rightness, warrant; 
              objectivity, truth &#8211; lies elsewhere, rather less accessible 
              to dexterities of method. (Geertz 1995) Persuasion, at least in 
              this lecture, depends on painting a picture of the world that you 
              the listeners believe, or at least do not entirely disbelieve. That 
              must be in part a literary as well as scholarly achievement, and 
              that is one of the ways in which my methodology fits with other 
              disciplines in Philosophical Faculty I such as European ethnography, 
              history and philosophy.</p>
            <h3>4 Scholarly context</h3>
            <p class="text"> For this lecture there are two scholarly contexts 
              that matter. The most specific of these is the discourse over digital 
              preservation that began with the articles by Anne R. Kenney and 
              Lynne K. Personius about the &#8221;The Cornell / Xerox / Commission 
              on Preservation and Access Joint Study in Digital Preservation&#8221;. 
              (Kenney &amp; Personius 1992). While I was not part of the project 
              team, I interacted with them on a daily basis. I will not go into 
              detail here about all of the articles that followed on this topic, 
              but I will mention a few key contributions, such as the research 
              that Margaret Hedstrom and Clifford Lampe did on emulation (Hedstrom 
              &amp; Lampe N.d.), the published research revolving around LOCKSS 
              and integrity-checking (Rosenthal, Robertson, Lipkis, Reich &amp; 
              Morabito 2005), and perhaps my own look at social models (Seadle 
              2006). In Germany the work of Ute Schwens and Hans Liegmann and 
              of Reinhard Altenh&ouml;ner is important for its emphasis on readability 
              and usability &#8212; issues that clearly matter to the library 
              community. (Schwens &amp; Liegmann 2004, Altenh&ouml;ner 2006)</p>
            <p class="text">The other scholarly context is broader. It has to 
              do with fears librarians have about the future of their profession. 
              We see artifacts of this context in research about the library as 
              place, where the role of the building often seems bound with our 
              identity as a profession. (Freeman, Bennett, Demas, Frischer, Peterson 
              &amp; Oliver 2005) We see this also in articles about joining library 
              and computing centers under a single information-centered administration. 
              (Bolin 2005) Repeated insistence that paper works will not go away 
              have the tone of a defensive reaction against the incursions of 
              the digital world. (Snowhill 2001) Concern about the new I-School 
              model serving libraries may reflect the anxieties of those who feel 
              their training is no longer as valued as it should be within the 
              profession. (Dillon &amp; Norris 2005) </p>
            <h3>5 Transformations</h3>
              <h4>5.1 Overview </h4>
              The establishment of the MARC (Machine Readable Cataloging) 
              standard in the US, the availability of tapes with cataloging copy 
              from the Library of Congress, and growth of OCLC cut the need for 
              catalogers dramatically. The rise of purchasing programs and the 
              growth in the importance of journal subscriptions cut out a substantial 
              portion of the book-selection workload for subject specialists. 
              The advent of small, specialized &#8221;boutique&#8221; digital 
              libraries in this context mattered far less than the massive conversion 
              of journal publication from paper to digital formats. The efforts 
              of national level organizations like (in the US) the Center for 
              Research Libraries to offer storage for a paper copy of journals 
              shows one of the tendencies in research libraries to abandon paper 
              and rely instead on digital formats. </p>
            <h4>5.2 First Transformation</h4>
              The evidence we believe is generally the evidence that we see ourselves. 
              I began working at the University of Chicago Library when I was 
              26 and was still writing my dissertation. At that time the cataloging 
              department filled a space twice the size of the Senatssaal where 
              we are now gathered, and most of the librarians sat almost cheek 
              by jowl in small cubicles. The term &#8221;cataloging&#8221; in 
              America includes both a formal description of a work and the assignment 
              of subject headings, classifications and other intellectually significant 
              parts of the metadata-creation process. In German terms, these librarians 
              did work that many German Fachreferenten do still. I worked for 
              the South Asia Library. Earlier it had seemed necessary to find 
              specialists who could create cataloging copy in the roughly 25 literary 
              languages with publications in India and Pakistan, but finding people 
              for all those languages was impossible. The South Asia Library took 
              the only reasonable solution of relying largely on computer tapes 
              that carried machine readable (MARC) cataloging copy from the Library 
              of Congress, plus the help of people like me who could learn enough 
              of the languages to match copy when necessary. By the time I left that library after nearly 5 years 
              for a career in computing, the crowding in the cataloging room had 
              eased visibly. This was the first step toward transforming libraries 
              into digital operations. A big piece of traditional work vanished. 
              But another set of tasks appeared. The computing staff in the basement 
              had visibly grown in numbers &#8211; almost as fast as the chairs 
              in the cataloging area had emptied. </p>
            <h4>5.3 Second Transformation</h4>

              <p>Another piece of evidence came in the following decade. The most 
              visible items of furniture on entering most research libraries were 
              the row after solid row of cabinets for catalog cards. They were 
              generally handsome objects of polished wood with steel or bronze-colored 
              handles and label holders. This furniture held the most important 
              tool for both librarians and researchers, because only via the catalog 
              cards could anyone find particular items among the five million 
              or so volumes in the stacks. </p>
            <p class="text">The timeframe in which Online Public Access Catalogs 
              (OPACs) replaced this furniture with less lovely though highly utilitarian 
              terminal clusters varied. At Northwestern University the process 
              happened early. James Aagard began programming on the NOTIS online 
              catalog in the early 1970s. By the late 1980s essentially all serious 
              research libraries had OPACS and automated systems. In Germany the 
              elimination of card catalogs began later and proceeded slowly. A 
              few libraries still have card catalogs for their older materials. 
              The conversion from paper to digital record keeping is, however, 
              now largely an accomplished fact and with it a major transformation 
              has occurred. Today the only way for librarians and researchers 
              to find a particular work is to interact with a computer system. 
              The old task of filing cards into the catalog vanished totally. 
              Whole departments of filing specialists closed or redistributed 
              their staff to new tasks, in so far as their training allowed. </p>
            <h4>5.4 Third Transformation</h4>

              <p>The third transformation is contemporary but no less obvious. I 
              noticed it first when I began to hear that new faculty at Michigan 
              State University&#8217;s Business School no longer just asked whether 
              the library subscribed to particular journals, but asked whether 
              it had those journals in electronic form. My own publisher, Emerald, 
              had long since digitized back issues. The paper copies continue 
              to be printed for journals that traditionally had paper versions, 
              even though our usage statistics today rely entirely on the digital 
              copies. Increasingly libraries today choose digital-only options 
              for subscriptions, or make a deal in which only one library in a 
              consortium keeps a paper copy. The effect is that current journal 
              acquisitions have become increasingly digital. Current periodical 
              reading rooms in US research libraries have shrunk noticeably because 
              they have fewer paper copies to display. With this change the old 
              job of checking-in physical copies of journals has diminished, as 
              has the work of gathering the fascicles for binding at the end of 
              the year. Most of these were low level jobs in areas that the public 
              rarely saw. The elimination of paper journals offered an opportunity 
              to address the space problem from ongoing acquisition of paper-based 
              monographs. In order to make room for these books, libraries began sending paper versions of digitized journals 
              (particularly those in the JSTOR collection) to remote storage, 
              or discarding them entirely. New reading tools like the iRex and 
              Sony Reader may make it more likely that monographs will follow 
              scholarly journals in the shift to digital formats. Whether paper 
              survives in some form or not is irrelevant. The changes in journal 
              subscriptions have already transformed the library world.</p>
            <h3>6 Consequences</h3>
            <h4>6.1 Overview</h4>

            <p>&#8217;Work&#8217; in the form of mechanical jobs has vanished and 
              new work in the form of technology tasks has appeared. &#8217;Works&#8217; 
              in paper are vanishing and works in digital formats have taken on 
              a major role in modern scholarship. The next section looks at the 
              consequences for library practice, research, and teaching. </p>
            <h4>6.2 Practice </h4>

            <p>Specific consequences of recent transformations can be found in 
              the staff directory and the staffing budget for US research libraries. 
              The number of names in the staff directory at US research libraries 
              has tended to decline as poorly paid low level positions vanish, 
              but staff budgets continue to grow because libraries are replacing 
              people who did routine jobs with better-paid, better-educated professionals. 
              It is clear from job advertisements that these new librarians need 
              to have skill-sets that include a strong technology background. 
              Employers typically also request an ability to work in teams and 
              a willingness to deliver a useful product to the end-user. These 
              are skills that businesses need too and unsurprisingly businesses 
              have been hiring many of the best students from US I-Schools. </p>
            <p class="text">Librarians without such skills can compete at best 
              for low-level positions. When some jobs vanish, others appear, but 
              when a document vanishes, it may be gone forever. Libraries were 
              among the first institutions to raise the alarm about the vulnerability 
              of digital works to loss over time, especially those institutions 
              like Cornell that already had strong technology skills. This concern 
              has spawned a number of major digital archiving projects with most 
              major US research libraries financially supporting one or more, 
              particularly LOCKSS and Portico. Relatively few German libraries 
              have incorporated serious long term digital archiving into their 
              routine operations. It would be unfair to say that they do not worry 
              about digital works vanishing, but many prefer to wait for a right 
              solution to appear. The right solution may, however, appear too 
              late, and it is hard to know what a good solution is without testing 
              multiple possibilities. KOPAL has evoked substantial interest and 
              a German LOCKSS community is being built. This is progress, but 
              much fundamental research in this area remains to do. The library 
              community has, for example, little or no experimental data to project 
              how reading habits and needs might evolve over time. The assumption 
              tends to be that people in 100 years will read as they do today, even though we know that readings habits 
              and methods 100 years ago were different. Research in this area 
              is urgently needed. </p>
            <h4>6.3 Research</h4>
            <p>I have heard librarians in Germany say that librarians ought 
              not do research and should merely serve the needs of other researchers. 
              At the APE conference in January 2008 in Berlin, Peter Murray-Rust 
              from Cambridge asked whether the work that librarians did in providing 
              journal subscriptions was any different than the work a purchasing 
              once did in ordering chemicals. No librarian could offer an answer 
              that he found convincing. Librarians that only buy and deliver publications 
              are in his terms clerks, not professionals. One area where librarians 
              ought to engage in serious research is long term digital archiving. 
              Librarians have long had responsibility for ensuring that information 
              persists. </p>
            <p class="text">Much of the current discussion on long term digital 
              archiving has focused on technology problems such as how to ensure 
              the integrity of the bitstream and how to make reasonable provision 
              for the usability of a digital object in 200 years. These are important, 
              but the issues are not merely technological. For example archiving 
              systems today tend to define the integrity of a digital object by 
              calculating its check-sum. The check-sum is a reasonable integrity 
              check at one level, since any change in the digital document whatsoever 
              will (under ordinary circumstances and with a very high degree of 
              likelihood) change the check-sum. But this is a purely mechanical 
              integrity measure. Few people would say that the integrity of a 
              work were lost because someone highlighted a word on a page, even 
              though the act of highlighting changes the check-sum. A useful research 
              question might be: how to define integrity in <br>
              computing terms so that the meaning maps well to socially accepted 
              norms. Today people worry that digital works will vanish if their 
              formats cannot be migrated to up-to-date versions. The library community 
              is attempting to persuade the non-library world to adopt preservation-friendly 
              formats. This is a logical solution, but the library community has 
              had little success in persuading corporations to adopt its standards, 
              except for products sold directly to libraries. We also know that 
              most files can be reverse-engineered with sufficient time and tools. 
              The barriers are time and cost, not capability. Research into the 
              costs and tools could provide alternatives if preservation- friendly 
              formats fail to become standard.</p>
            <p class="text"> A related research project is to ask to what degree 
              preserving the look and feel of current documents matters for the 
              long term. In a small experiment with students last semester my 
              assumption that the visual context would matter to them was overturned. 
              Project Gutenberg has preserved older works in plain ASCII text. 
              Plain ASCII also loads relatively easily into ebook readers like 
              the iRex or Sony. Newly published editions of nineteenth century 
              books in fact almost always reformat the text to modern fonts and 
              layouts. It may be that our assumptions about context preservation 
              need testing. Part of the testing needs also to consider how humans 
              interact with works. In one of my classes I talk about the evolution 
              of the &#8221;book&#8221; as an information system. We know that 
              people have interacted differently with books over time as their 
              structure changed and as the number and variety of books grew. It 
              seems likely that these relationships will continue to evolve and 
              that the interactions between humans and computing systems may also 
              become a key area of research for understanding the long-term usability 
              of archived information. </p>
            <h4>6.4 Teaching </h4>

            <p>Leading North American library programs have replaced courses in 
              well-established subjects like cataloging with a curriculum that 
              includes human-computer-interaction and information economics. At 
              first libraries doubted whether they wanted people with that kind 
              of training. Ten years later employment for students from these 
              programs is near 100 per cent and jobs for students from more traditional 
              schools that emphasize so-called practical skills are harder to 
              find. Success in the modern library world depends not just on technological 
              facility, though technology is important. Library schools recognize 
              that students need the ability to solve problems and adapt to new 
              circumstances. Skills of that sort come from engaging with real 
              questions. This is one reason why I-Schools try to involve students 
              in cutting edge research where the students learn that professors 
              do not have the answers: instead they have research methods that 
              can be applied to get answers. At Humboldt we have a proud tradition 
              of the unity of teaching and research. This tradition fits well with 
              plans for the Institut f&uuml;r Bibliotheks- und Informationswissenschaft, 
              but it also means shifting our teaching from more traditional content. 
              Students make particularly good subjects to involve in research 
              on long term digital archiving because they are in some sense the 
              first generation that really will have to rely on effective digital 
              archiving when they reach my age. Interactions with them have already 
              changed my ideas about issues like readability and data integrity. </p>
            <h3>7 Conclusions </h3>
            <p class="text"> When I accepted Humboldt&#8217;s invitation to take 
              this professorship, I mentally also accepted the challenge to do 
              what I could to prepare our students for a future that some of them 
              are not quite sure that they want. One of our retired faculty has 
              said that when students used to inquire about becoming a librarian 
              because they loved books and reading, she told them to study something 
              else. We may nonetheless be a profession of 7 book lovers, but if 
              the transformations of the last 30 or 40 years mean anything, our 
              job is something else. A bitstream is probably inherently less lovable 
              than a handsomely-bound book. Nonetheless a bitstream appears to 
              be the future of information and we need to prepare our students 
              for dealing with it. The challenge that libraries face in making 
              sure that these works do not vanish demands hard thought and rigorous 
              research. The work that vanished could still vanish. We could also 
              vanish as a profession if we cling to the past, and we could lose 
              a significant part of the intellectual output of the present day 
              if we lock ourselves into solutions without empirical research about 
              the probable effectiveness of those solutions in a century or two. 
              Nonetheless libraries are fairly robust institutions. They have 
              survived many transformations over the centuries and odds are they 
              can survive again with their contents intact if our students make 
              the right choices. The choice, dear students, is up to you. </p>
