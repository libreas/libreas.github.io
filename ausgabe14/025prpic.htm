    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p>A<span class="text">rt theorists&#8217; engage with the issue of 
              archives from an entirely opposite angle than librarians and archivists. 
              In <em>The Big Archive</em>, Spieker compares artists throughout 
              the twentieth century to archivists and those who have created archives. 
              Heavily discussing aspects of time, and chronologically capturing 
              the blossoming of archives from eighteenth-century legal depositories, 
              to nineteenth-century record-houses, to present-day historical resources, 
              the book&#8217;s main focus is the role the bureaucratic archive 
              has played in the creation of twentieth-century art and installation.</span></p>
            <p class="text">&#8220;[T]he earliest known archives contained objects 
              neatly strung up on suspended threads, &#8216;one thing after another&#8217;. 
              These archive strings functioned as navigational tools&#8212;a kind 
              of cybernetic feedback&#8212;that allowed their users to keep their 
              bearings in time and space.&#8221; (56) Not only is this an intriguing 
              form of a finding aid, this theme of staying connected with the 
              origins of archives recurs throughout the book.</p>
            <p class="text">Memory, loss, and possession play a part in artists&#8217; 
              interpretation of archives. While archives have existed ever since 
              people began documentation of any sort, mainly administrative forms 
              are important to the author: the flurry of paper created by typewriters, 
              files and card indexes. James Beniger referred to these technologies 
              &#8220;as a &#8216;control revolution&#8217; in the period 1880-1930, 
              a reaction to the &#8216;loss of economic and political control 
              &#8230; during the Industrial Revolution&#8217;.&#8221; (5) The 
              author sees twentieth-century modernism as a reaction to the storage 
              crisis brought on after Beniger&#8217;s revolution; a paper jam 
              due to an uptick of data.</p>
            <p class="text">What happens when an archive collects everything? 
              Is the archive haunted by its contents, or just overflowing with 
              (largely) useless ephemera? What is the purpose of modern archives&#8212;to 
              reconnect us with that which we&#8217;ve lost? These questions are 
              answered loquaciously in the text. &#8220;Archives do not record 
              experience so much as its absence; they mark the point where an 
              experience is missing from its proper place, and what is returned 
              to us in an archive may well be something we never possessed in 
              the first place.&#8221; (3)</p>
            <p class="text">Spieker starts by introducing the nineteenth-century 
              archive, a theme that he ties throughout the book, regardless of 
              era or topic, and delves briefly into its technical aspects. He 
              explains that the role of archives in the 1800s was as depositories 
              records, and served as a register for time itself. The nineteenth-century 
              archive impacted twentieth-century art through the study and challenge 
              of the roles that time and irrationality play in an archive.</p>
            <p class="text">He awkwardly attempts to work Freud into the book, 
              a chapter that seems a far stretch to relate to the book&#8217;s 
              topic. Next, Dadaist montage and Duchamp&#8217;s readymades are 
              discussed, particularly their attitudes toward chance and their 
              thorough self-documentation. This work&#8217;s challenge to the 
              nineteenth-century archive is discussed as the anti-archive in response 
              to the paper jam after WWI, and the refusal to acknowledge the nineteenth-century 
              archive as anything else than garbage.</p>
            <p class="text">This segways into the Surrealist&#8217;s critique 
              of the archive and their issues with time. Surrealists were obsessed 
              with the documentation of their movement. They tried to understand 
              the data of the unconscious, and kept meticulous notes on their 
              ideas, actions and dreams in their Bureau de Recherches, an archive 
              based on memory. &#8220;[T]he Surrealist archive did not seek to 
              introduce order&#8230;into what is conscious and known, but to detect 
              organization in what is unknown.&#8221; (103) The medium of film 
              is touched on, and its relationship to the museum-as-archive. </p>
            <p class="text">Interestingly, he draws a parallel between the production 
              of paperwork in the nineteenth-century as the task of women, but 
              that its &#8220;arrangement, preservation, and protection in the 
              registry were the undisputed prerogative of men.&#8221; (23) An 
              entire chapter could have been written on the gender asymmetry present 
              in archives: the need to separate women from men, the fear that 
              women might blab the archives&#8217; secrets, and the view that 
              archives were men&#8217;s domains, due to the strict imposition 
              of order.</p>
            <p class="text">The most interesting of the chapters is Chapter 7, 
              &#8220;Archive, Database, Photography&#8221;, tying &#8220;the interest 
              shown by late-twentieth-century artists in the (photo) archive&#8230;to 
              the waning of the aesthetic of shock (photomontage) during the 1920s.&#8221; 
              (Benjamin H. D. Buchloh, 131) Focusing on postwar art, he meditates 
              on the archive/database so consistently found in the photography 
              of this time period. As with archives, photography allows us to 
              perceive the past in the context of the present by &#8220;transform[ing] 
              temporal relationships into spatial ones.&#8221; (27) Albrecht Meydenbauer&#8217;s 
              <em>Archive of Historical Monuments</em> (1881) consisted of over 
              10,000 photographs of 837 buildings, as a testament to photography&#8217;s 
              ability to defend monuments from time and loss. During the nineteenth 
              century, the creations of photography-based archives of monuments 
              were a popular form of memory preservation. Later on, from 1925-1927, 
              August Sander&#8217; archived people&#8217;s professions in <em>People 
              of the 20th Century</em>, another photographic survey that acted 
              as an archive from its inception. In the late twentieth century, 
              artists complied and utilized photo archives in new forms, but still 
              ones that referenced earlier archival practices. Walid Raad&#8217;s 
              <em>Atlas Group Archive</em> (1989-2004) was designed to research 
              and document the contemporary history of Lebanon, especially the 
              wars of 1975 to 1990. (152) Each file in his archive consisted of 
              audio that had been both found and produced as an answer to the 
              experience of war. This use of archive-as-medium became prevalent 
              during the late twentieth century.</p>
            <p class="text">In each chapter, Spieker chooses a handful of artists&#8217; 
              works to illustrate his points, from contemporary artist Sophie 
              Calle, to Soviet photographer Boris Mikhailov, to architect Le Corbusier. 
              In late twentieth-century art and art criticism, the archive became 
              a wildly popular choice of medium, as reflected by the wide scope 
              of artists represented in the book. Walter Benjamin&#8217;s &#8220;Work 
              of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction&#8221; is referenced 
              in regards to photography as its ability to fragment the object 
              being captured in still format, much like an archive preserves only 
              fragments of history and time. Ukrainian photographer Boris Mikhailov 
              is highly aware of photo archives, as their absence loudly reminded 
              the Soviet people of their oppression, since journalists weren&#8217;t 
              allowed to photograph the war and famine of the 1930s. The entire 
              visual history of that time period has been sanitized; edited and 
              used &#8220;as a tool for widespread repression and collective amnesia.&#8221; 
              (160) Mikhailov&#8217;s own work emphasizes repetition and pairs, 
              and is an answer to the idea of the archive as its own entity&#8212;his 
              work suggests that an archive is only as useful as how the user 
              interacts with it.</p>
            <p class="text">Appropriately, and almost too late, Spieker mentions 
              the role of the museum in art based on archives. He talks about 
              the relationship between the two, how one fuels the other, and how 
              the museum&#8217;s storehouse is shorthand for an archive. As early 
              as the 1920s, Soviet Futurists were calling for a destruction of 
              art museums, to be replaced with a &#8220;new museum&#8221;&#8212;thus 
              the blending of the museum and its archives. They used the word 
              &#8220;archive&#8221; as a derogatory term for a &#8220;revisionist 
              attitude toward the past.&#8221; (105) Aleksandr Rodchenko, as head 
              of the Soviet Museum Bureau, used the term &#8220;archive&#8221; 
              to mean the traditional art museum, as, in his eyes, the archive 
              was only meant for the &#8220;static preservation of art, serving 
              ethnographers, specialists, and amateurs.&#8221; (106)</p>
            <p class="text">The book concludes by looking at artists who aren&#8217;t 
              afraid of disorder and destruction in an archive. Since archives 
              are equated with a collective memory, Spieker introduces contemporary 
              artists that play with this concept, and what it means now that 
              everyone can both have access to archives through the computer, 
              and can produce their own archives. His example of Andrea Fraser&#8217;s 
              performance piece <em>Information Room</em> (1998) in which she 
              invited visitors to a museum&#8217;s archives to dig through its 
              documents until they were completely out of place, comments on the 
              removal or destruction of records, and what information is or is 
              not sacred in an archive. This work can also now be seen in the 
              light of digital archives: what does an archive look like, and how 
              useful does it become when only fragments are available to the public, 
              and seem disjointed as experienced through the syntax of the internet?</p>
            <p><span class="text">The book swings between spot-on observances 
              and insights, to wordy and heady exaggerations of an idea. While 
              his discussion of photography as a medium familiar to archives is 
              thrilling, his arguments about the psychology of archives seem out 
              of place in this book on art. The chronological organization of 
              the book is a good solution to the near-impossible task of corralling 
              all the information on archive-driven artwork into some semblance 
              of a whole. Spieker can spout at length both about twentieth century 
              artists, and archives equally. Overall, this book is a great addition 
              to any library where those curious about archival history or contemporary 
              art roam.</span><br>
