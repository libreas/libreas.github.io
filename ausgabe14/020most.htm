    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">            <p class="text">The 17th annual BOBCATSSS symposium was held in Porto, 
              Portugal from 28-30 January 2009. <br>
              Besides hosting the conference in a city rich in beauty and history, 
              the symposium itself stands apart as particularly contemporary and 
              wholly unique symposium organized by library and information science 
              students for library and information students. BOBCATSSS, under 
              the auspices of EUCLID (European Association for Library and Information 
              Education and Research), was created and held to increase communication 
              and collaboration between students from Eastern and Western European 
              universities. This year&#8217;s symposium had over 300 participants 
              representing 40 different countries on five different continents.</p>
            <p class="text">The theme of this year&#8217;s BOBCATSSS was &#8220;Challenges 
              for the New Information Professional&#8221;, an appropriate theme 
              considering the continuously shifting and changing nature of library 
              information science field. The subthemes were organized around the 
              interdisciplinarity of information science, the information professional 
              and information management, the impact of new technologies on the 
              life of the information professional, the rise and fall of physical 
              libraries and archives, information literacy, eLibraries &amp; eArchives, 
              and Librarian 2.0.</p>
            <p class="text">The theme was explored by the three keynote speakers 
              at the opening ceremony: Tom Wilson accepted his Bobcat of the Year 
              award from the prior year. Wilson also spoke on the topic of &#8220;Thinking 
              about the future&#8221;, talking about both the future research 
              needs of library and information professionals and the impact of 
              non-library and information science issues impact on the way we 
              do business. His example was world overpopulation, with the world 
              population expected to surpass nine billion by 2050. On a lighter 
              note, Kimmo Tuominen was able to combine Star Wars, punk rock, participation, 
              and cognitive authority in a speech titled &#8220;Cognitive authority 
              and Web 2.0.&#8221; Fernanda Ribeiro, the final keynote speaker, 
              talked about &#8220;Information science: From disciplinary unity 
              to the diversity of the profession.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">The symposium offerings were plentiful and diverse 
              including paper presentations, company presentations, workshops, 
              panels, and poster presentations. The overall offerings are broader 
              than what could be explored in the rest of the report.<br>
              For obvious reasons the majority of presentations dealt with issues 
              relating specifically to the challenges of being a new information 
              professional in an increasingly global world. It became apparent 
              that to survive in the fast-paced global environment, library and 
              information science professionals must be responsive, flexible, 
              learn new technologies, create and develop partnerships, develop 
              leadership and entrepreneurial skills all while mastering or maintaining 
              many of the skills or abilities needed in the traditional physical 
              library. Is that it?</p>
            <img src="bilder/porto.jpg" width="600" height="338" class="smallborder">
            <p><small>Is that it? We wouldn't 
                  bet our shirt off the back but it appears that BOBCATSSS-attendee 
                  and </span><a href="http://sebastianwilke.wordpress.com/" target="_blank" class="back">LIS-Traveller</a><span class="erklaerung"> 
                  Sebastian Wilke catched a nice perspective down Porto's R. de 
                  S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o Novo towards the river Douro. If you 
                  walk down this street in the Ribeira-neighborhood and turn to 
                  the left there is the Rua dos Canastreiros right beside. And 
                  once there you may snack in the rather famous restaurant <em>Chez 
                  Lapin</em> for some<em> Bacalhau &agrave; Br&aacute;s</em>, 
                  probably taken with a fine <em>Rabigato</em>. You've time to 
                  watch out for some<em> Rabelos</em> passing by afterwards. </small></p>
            <p class="text">While the challenges that lay in front of future information 
              professionals sometimes seem daunting, the panel session on education 
              and training in LIS gave a little hope. A recent Portuguese graduate 
              eloquently spoke about how she and fellow LIS students are gaining 
              skills in our education that prepare us with a valuable skill set 
              that can work in many spheres of both the private and public sector 
              in roles where other employees cannot succeed, especially in IT 
              areas where understanding user needs is vital. The global nature 
              of library and information science was also addressed in this session 
              as Anne Maria Tammaro, chair of the Education and Training Section 
              with IFLA, expressed the Education and Training Section&#8217;s 
              desire to have more student involvement.</p>
            <p class="text">While many of the new challenges to information professionals 
              take place outside the physical walls of the traditional library, 
              there are also many challenges within the walls. The physical library 
              is still an integral part of the library. In their presentation 
              entitled &#8220;The fall and rise of the physical library&#8221;, 
              Henrik Jochumsen and Caspar Hvenegaard Rasmussen, from the Royal 
              School of Library and Information Science in K&oslash;benhavn, discussed 
              how the physical library is alive and well.<br>
              Speaking of walls there were also a number of presentations that 
              looked at how barriers to library and information services could 
              be diminished by understanding users&#8217; environmental needs, 
              whether by fostering a multicultural environment or understanding 
              the context in which historians work best.</p>
            <p class="text">Sebastian Wilke and Jessica Euler presented a paper 
              entitled &#8220;Diversity management as a key challenge to the library 
              in the multicultural society,&#8221; which was the byproduct of 
              a project where a class created a student anthology around the provision 
              of services to a multicultural patron base. They discussed promoting 
              multifaceted activities and services that allow for an appreciation 
              of different cultural heritages and encourage the use of a library 
              as a social meeting space. The idea of creating a student anthology 
              around a specific topic is a great idea for a library and information 
              science program.</p>
            <p class="text">Abdelhamid Boujdad Mkadem, in his &#8220;Digitizing 
              old manuscripts in Morocco: A historical research issue,&#8221; 
              presentation, analyzed the information needs of historians using 
              old manuscripts in Morocco, in order to determine if digitization 
              of said manuscripts would benefit the information needs of historians. 
              This was an interesting study because it shows that even though 
              items can be digitized it is not always what the users want or that 
              they will use, so in general when thinking about a digitization 
              project it is important to know your audience. The findings were, 
              although historians appreciate the importance of digitization, they 
              prefer to study the manuscripts directly. The main reason for this 
              is they appreciate the added knowledge and context that the owners 
              of manuscripts add to the historians&#8217; study of the manuscripts.</p>
            <p><span class="text">At any conference, symposium, or gathering of 
              two or more library and information science professionals there 
              are bound to be conversations, connections, and collaborations. 
              For example, at this event the author met a library student during 
              the very first coffee break of the symposium who was trying to set 
              up an internship with a library in the author&#8217;s city. They 
              were able to exchange contact information and now the student will 
              have at least one contact when he is doing his internship. It is 
              important to have communication, conversation and collaboration 
              between future information professionals. Based on the experiences 
              of this year&#8217;s symposium in Porto this is happening and BOBCATSSS 
              is an integral part to communication between library and information 
              science students. At the beginning of BOBCATSSS 2009 Tom Wilson 
              opened his talk with the following statement: &#8220;The past is 
              a foreign country &#8211; and so is the future.&#8221; While the 
              both the past and future are foreign countries there are still steps 
              we can take as information professionals to make the exploration 
              of those foreign countries a little less daunting. For those who 
              attended BOBCATSSS 2009, there is one foreign country in the past 
              that is not so foreign anymore. As for the future, those who plan 
              to attend BOBCATSSS 2010 will definitely have a foreign country 
              in their future, one future information professionals should explore.
