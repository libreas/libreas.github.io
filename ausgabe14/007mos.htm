    <div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>T<span class="text">he United States is now officially in an economic 
              recession and has been since December 2007 (NBER, 2008). The effects 
              of the recession have been resounding in the United States, with 
              an increasing number of layoffs and foreclosures announced every 
              day. The unemployment rate in the United States sits at 7.6 %, the 
              highest since 1991 (US Department of Labor Statistics, 2009). As 
              the economic pressures have increased, so have the media reports 
              about the increased library usage in response to these economic 
              pressures. The New York Times, CBS News, National Public Radio (NPR), 
              and Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) are just a handful of media outlets 
              that have featured news items on the subject (see links below).</span></p>
            <p class="text">In times of economic crisis libraries find themselves 
              in a Catch-22 situation. A Catch-22, as defined by the Oxford English 
              Dictionary, is &#8220;a supposed law or regulation containing provisions 
              which are mutually frustrating&#8221;. As the economic crisis continues 
              and deepens, there is increased usage of the library, while at the 
              same time library funding decreases. How can libraries most effectively 
              respond to this Catch-22?</p>
            <p><span class="text">This paper will look at how libraries have responded 
              to economic recessions in the past, specifically during the Great 
              Depression, and how libraries are responding to the present economic 
              recession, specifically focusing on the experiences of two very 
              different library systems in the state of Minnesota. One library 
              system, the Kitchigami Regional Library System, serves a rural 6000 
              square mile five-county area with a population of 130,000 (</span><a href="http://www.krls.org/about_krls/about_krls.html" target="_blank" class="back">www.krls.org/about_krls/about_krls.html</a><span class="text">). 
              Another library system, the Ramsey County Public Library System, 
              is located in the second most populous county in Minnesota and serves 
              an urban/suburban population of over half a million people (</span><a href="http://www.ramsey.lib.mn.us/" target="_blank" class="back">www.ramsey.lib.mn.us/</a><span class="text">). 
              By looking both to the past reaction to economic recessions and 
              to the experiences of the present it will hopefully shed light on 
              how libraries can best respond to the tension between the increased 
              library usage and the stagnating or diminishing funding during times 
              of economic downturn.</span></p>
            <h3>Past Recessions</span></h3>
            <p class="text">Historically speaking, the most obvious place to look 
              for examples of libraries&#8217; reactions to economic recessions 
              is the Great Depression. During the Great Depression there was a 
              huge anti-taxation movement that libraries, and more specifically 
              the American Library Association (ALA), attempted to thwart. Three 
              key themes pop out when looking at the work the ALA was doing to 
              stop the anti-taxation movement, which were:</p>
            <ul>
              <li class="zitat"> action, </li>
              <li> <span class="zitat">publicity, and </span></li>
              <li> <span class="zitat">cooperation.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p class="text">&#8220;Do not wait for others to take the lead&#8221; 
              (Lydenberg, Milam, &amp; Gallagher, 1933, p. 169). These were the 
              words of Harry Miller Lydenberg, Carl H. Milam, and Michael F. Gallagher 
              in their open letter to the ALA members about the formation of citizens&#8217; 
              councils. These citizens&#8217; councils were formed:</p>
            <p class="text">1. [T]o promote interest in local and state governmental 
              problems, to the end that the present widespread demands for reduction 
              of public expenditures may produce actual and permanent improvements 
              in the governmental organization, the tax system, and the services 
              rendered by public and semi-public agencies.</p>
            <p class="text">2. To encourage the organization of local and state 
              citizens&#8217; councils to consider the problems of maintaining 
              essential community services in the face of the need for reduction 
              of public expenditures (ALA, 1933, p. 170).</p>
            <p class="text">Some specific actions citizens&#8217; councils were 
              asked to do to promote constructive economy and good government 
              included addressing their spending, addressing efficiency of services, 
              projecting future funding problems by addressing potential changes 
              in levies or property taxes, and seeking relevant information from 
              institutions and experts to benchmark services provided (Lydenberg, 
              Milam, &amp; Gallagher, 1933, p. 170).</p>
            <p class="text">Cooperation was another key factor in the strategy 
              of the ALA, libraries, and citizens&#8217; councils.</p>
            <blockquote> 
              <p class="zitat"> &#8220;It is hoped that it may be used to bring 
                into existence some coalition or organization of the friends of 
                all the educational and cultural and perhaps social agencies, 
                locally and by states, in order that they may be as articulate 
                in demanding the maintenance of essential services on a reasonable 
                basis as the organizations for tax reduction are for anything 
                that will reduce public expenditures.&#8221; (Lydenberg &amp; 
                Milam, 1933, p. 57)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p class="text">Finally, publicity was a very important part of the 
              strategy of maintaining public library services. One way the ALA 
              achieved this was by adopting two statements; one on the &#8220;Reduction 
              of Public Expenditures&#8221; and the other was titled &#8220;Increased 
              Demand for Library Service.&#8221; The purpose of these statements 
              was to counter anti-taxation groups blanket statement that government 
              funding should be cut, regardless of the services offered. The statements&#8217; 
              message was that yes, government should be responsible in their 
              spending and work to diminish wasteful spending, but not at the 
              expense of socially useful services and certainly not before wasteful 
              spending was curtailed.</p>

                    We often wonder, <em>who's gonna drive us home</em> (and how) 
                    when the automotive industry has vanished and the cars lay 
                    broke. After Fordism there is Toyotism they say. But as Toyota 
                    suffers as well, what will follow now? Without ref to the 
                    country in the shown example photographed during the big depression 
                    days 80 years ago, one may think of the possibiliy of turkeyism 
                    which comes even leaner than lean manufacturing. The engine 
                    is somehow self-sustaining and runs with seeds instead of 
                    fuel. And we have to get used to a slow way of life. Both 
                    aspects might not be only negative especially as values like 
                    slow-reading and spending time offline getting popular again. 
                    And we can still carry on! Just differently. </p>

             <h3>Present Day Minnesota</h3>
            <p class="text">In order to understand the reaction of Minnesota libraries 
              to the economic recession, it is important to describe the economic 
              situation in Minnesota and the way libraries are funded in Minnesota.</p>
            <p><span class="text">Minnesota&#8217;s constitution mandates the 
              state maintain a balanced budget (Article XI, section 6, Minnesota 
              Constitution). As a result, as the recession has deepened, the Minnesota 
              state budget has continued to be affected. The state has an estimated 
              $426 million shortfall for 2009, which has resulted in a $229 million 
              unallotment of funds (</span><a href="http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/budget/unallotment-08.pdf" target="_blank" class="back">/www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/budget/unallotment-08.pdf</a><span class="text">). 
              The future does not look much better, with the January 2009 Economic 
              Update describing the situation in the following way: &#8220;The 
              U.S. economic outlook is, to put it charitably, grim&#8221; (</span><a href="(http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/09/update-jan09.pdf" target="_blank" class="back">www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/09/update-jan09.pdf</a><span class="text">). 
              The November Forecast from the office of Minnesota Management &amp; 
              Budget predicts a $4.847 billion dollar shortfall for Fiscal Year 
              2010-11, 9.4 % below previous forecasts (</span><a href="http://www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/08/complete-nov08.pdf" target="_blank" class="back">www.mmb.state.mn.us/doc/fu/08/complete-nov08.pdf</a><span class="text">).</span></p>
            <p class="text">The way public libraries are funded varies slightly 
              based on the type of library system, but the majority of library 
              funding in Minnesota comes from property taxes. Considering the 
              current financial crisis was caused by a crash in the housing bubble 
              and has resulted in a precipitous drop in housing prices, it is 
              worrying that the major stream of funding for public libraries in 
              Minnesota comes from the ability to levy taxes on property.</p>
            <p class="text">The Kitchigami Regional Library System (KRLS) is a 
              consolidated regional public library in northern Minnesota. There 
              are two models for regional public library systems in Minnesota, 
              the consolidated model and the federated model. In the consolidated 
              model administration is consolidated at the headquarters. In the 
              federated model administration is locally held in the branch libraries, 
              with the headquarters only providing system wide services. Ramsey 
              County Library System is a county library system, so all administrative 
              power remains within one county. Kitchigami Regional Library System 
              is a consolidated regional public library in northern Minnesota.</p>
            <p><span class="text">KRLS has two primary funding streams. The first 
              funding stream is derived from a levy or tax on city or county property 
              <br>
              (</span><a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?year=2008&id=134.07#stat.134.07" target="_blank" class="back">www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?year=2008&amp;id=134.07#stat.134.07</a><span class="text">). 
              The second funding source comes in the form of regional library 
              basic system support grants, which is also derived from property 
              taxes, but is distributed by the state (</span><a href="https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?year=2008&id=134.34#stat.134.34" target="_blank" class="back">www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?year=2008&amp;id=134.34#stat.134.34</a><span class="text">). 
              Another small source of funding is Local Government Aid (LGA). LGA 
              are tax monies collected by the state, which are then redistributed 
              to cities who use it to fund municipal services such as libraries, 
              police, and fire departments.</span></p>
            <p class="text">A basic budget breakdown for KRLS finds 70 % of funding 
              going towards personnel, 20 % towards technology, and 5 % goes to 
              collection development. KRLS serves an economically disadvantaged 
              area. As a result they do not derive any of their funding from fines, 
              because library users would not be able to pay and implementing 
              fines would result in a greater loss of items.</p>
            <p class="text">KRLS has been lucky with staffing for 2009, as they 
              have not yet had to reduce staff. However, the counties have made 
              it known that cuts will be passed to the departments. Marian Ridge, 
              director of the Kitchigami Regional Library System, states that 
              she expects &#8220;3-4 extremely difficult years&#8221; ahead for 
              the library system.</p>
            <p class="text">Ramsey County Library&#8217;s funding has already 
              been affected by the economic downturn: 82 % of the Ramsey County 
              Library&#8217;s funding comes from property taxes on the county 
              level, 6 % from Local Government Aid (LGA), 7 % from fines, and 
              the remainder from a number of miscellaneous sources. The LGA was 
              unallotted in December and, according to Susan Nemitz, director 
              of the Ramsey County Public Libraries, will be cut significantly 
              in the future. Nemitz also reports that fines and other funds are 
              down. However, the county property taxes remain stable at the moment.</p>
            <p class="text">Ramsey County Public Library&#8217;s budget strategy, 
              as it moves through the turbulent economic times, includes benchmarking 
              to demonstrate value, lobbying through the Minnesota Library Association 
              (MLA) and Ramsey County, and by reducing spending with cuts to the 
              book budget, implementing a hiring freeze, banning travel, etc.</p>
            <h3> Increases in Services</h3>
            <p class="text">Kitchigami Public Library System has seen a great 
              increase in a number of services. The greatest being a 32.5 % increase 
              in the usage of the mobile library. This is indicative of library 
              users&#8217; response to the massive increase in gas prices during 
              the fall of 2008. In addition, KRLS has seen a 14 % increase in 
              circulation during the last year along with increased usage of computers. 
              Ridge stated that computers at the library are often fully booked 
              from the minute the library opens until closing time. According 
              to Becky Walpole, a librarian in the KRLS, patrons are only allowed 
              up to an hour per day on the computers, but no more than that due 
              to high demand. Walpole also mentioned the affect increased library 
              usage has had on staffing stating Walpole: &#8220;We usually have 
              only one staff member on desk at a time, to allow others to do behind-the-scene 
              things. We now often have two at the desk and at times, three.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">Ridge also cited a number of behaviors or uses of 
              library services that are directly related to the effects of the 
              economic recession. There are people who are giving up their high-speed 
              internet lines and using the wireless at the library instead, people 
              are using the computers to register for benefits online, people 
              are printing out coupons and using the computers for comparative 
              pricing, and families are using the library for more recreational 
              material rather than buying it themselves.</p>
            <p class="text">KRLS has focused its efforts in responding to the 
              needs of library users in a number of areas, the largest is the 
              technology needs of users. KRLS has focused on providing more computers 
              and maintaining broadband speeds. This is difficult, because whenever 
              the branches add computers or broadband, there is a corresponding 
              increased usage. This results in a constantly strained broadband.</p>
            <p class="text"> KRLS has also responded to the educational and career 
              related needs of the library users. The rural location of the library 
              users precludes them from accessing traditional educational opportunities. 
              Many library users can only afford to take university classes or 
              continuing education classes online. Many people use the library 
              to work on these classes. In addition to supporting distance learning, 
              KRLS has also invested in online databases, that address the economic 
              and career related needs of the users. For example, they have databases 
              containing information about auto repair and maintenance as well 
              as information on stocks, mutual funds, and health care services. 
              Database usage has seen a 50 % increase over the last year.</p>
            <p class="text">Ramsey County Library has seen increases in usage 
              of library services and resources in a number of areas. From 2007 
              to 2008 circulation has increased by 8.9 % (a new record), visits 
              are up 5 %, public computer use is up 38 %, web site use is up 10 
              %, wireless network use is up 61 %, and computer class usage is 
              up 23.7 %. Ramsey County Library is responding to this increase 
              usage by increasing the bandwidth.</p>
            <p class="text">According to Nemitz, the biggest challenge they face 
              is &#8220;flat staffing over the last 10 years with a 59 % increase 
              in circulation&#8221;. At the same time Susan Nemitz does report 
              a number of successes, including: convinced the county to invest 
              $2 million in auto-handling and RFID, convinced the county to invest 
              over $25 million in remodeling over the last five years, started 
              a volunteer program, that last year provided 25,000 hours of service, 
              and received over $100,000 in book donations last year.</p>
            <h3> Carry On</h3>
            <p class="text"><span class="text">The economic recession means increased 
              use of and strain on library resources, all while coping with budgetary 
              restrictions. The past response to economic recession should help 
              guide libraries in the response they have to today&#8217;s economic 
              recession. Libraries should take action and be proactive in the 
              response to the challenges, that lay before them, they should publicize 
              the importance of the work libraries do and the services they provide, 
              and finally libraries should cooperate with other agencies who are 
              providing other social and government services. <br>
              In addition to learning from the past, the experiences of the Kitchigami 
              Public Library System and the Ramsey County Library can help shape 
              our understanding of what is going on at the ground level, as far 
              as the needs of users are concerned. Becky Walpole reminds us of 
              the vital role of libraries, when she states, &#8220;For many of 
              the patrons we serve, we are not a luxury, but a necessity&#8221;. 
              Finally, in response to the challenges the economic recession will 
              place on libraries, Ridge recommends taking the advice of a poster 
              from WWII, which reads &#8220;Keep Calm and Carry On&#8221;:</span></p>
