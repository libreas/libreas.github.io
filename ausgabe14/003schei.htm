              and academic publishing, it can often seem as though there are just 
              two sides, for and against, and that these groups are easily delineated 
              into two camps: consumers and creators. The consumers are the students, 
              libraries, and other readers and researchers who want increased 
              access to journal articles, monographs, and other work, and they 
              want that access to be free and immediate. The creators are the 
              scholarly authors who write these works, and the publishers and 
              vendors who disseminate them. These are people who have relied on 
              traditional publishing methods as a means to give creditability 
              to their work, to come by prestige, and to profit.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">However, this dichotomy does not reflect today&#8217;s 
              academic world, even in the disciplines of the humanities, which 
              have been slower to embrace new publishing models than the sciences. 
              There are growing numbers of humanities scholars who view open access 
              publishing as a probable, and even desirable, future. The work and 
              perspectives of three historians are encouraging examples of how 
              scholars in the humanities might come to view open access.</p>

              between technology and history moved them to start producing a podcast 
              in March of 2007. This podcast, Digital Campus (</span><a href="http://digitalcampus.tv/" class="back">http://digitalcampus.tv/</a><span class="text">), 
              is &#8220;a biweekly discussion of how digital media and technology 
              are affecting learning, teaching, and scholarship at colleges, universities, 
              libraries, and museums&#8221;. Open access is a topic that comes 
              up often in conversation on the podcast, and on each of the scholars&#8217; 
              blogs (linked at the beginning of this paragraph).</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">On Digital Campus, Cohen, Scheinfeldt, and Kelly 
              have expressed their enthusiasm for open access and frustration 
              for those in their field who object to any changes to the traditional 
              publishing model. In their open access advocacy, these scholars 
              offer a mix of &#8220;practical and political&#8221;, in Scheinfeldt&#8217;s 
              words<span class="text"><span>[<a name="f3b" id="f3b"></a></span></span></span><a href="#f3" class="back">Fn3</a><span class="text"><span class="text"><span>]</span> 
              </span></span></p>
            <p class="text">Cohen describes the practical side this way: &#8220;1) 
              it's a public good to put scholarship out there rather than behind 
              gates; 2) it's an efficient use of today's technology; 3) it makes 
              no sense from a pragmatic standpoint to have closed access scholarship; 
              4) it's better for the producers as well as the consumers.&#8221; 
              Scheinfeldt adds, &#8220;if the point of research, scholarship, 
              and education is to increase and extend knowledge, then making knowledge 
              available to the most people on the most open terms only makes sense.&#8221; 
              Kelly&#8217;s comments extend these ideas by saying, &#8220;As scholars 
              we have an obligation to make our work as much a part of the ongoing 
              conversation taking place online as we can. If there is a gap between 
              &#8216;scholars&#8217; and &#8216;the public&#8217; then I think 
              we've really fallen down on the job.&#8221;</p>
            <p class="text">There is also a more mission based, ethical argument 
              for open access, which Scheinfeldt calls the political side of his 
              beliefs on the subject: &#8220;politically, all of us (scholars, 
              cultural heritage professionals, educators) are supported by public 
              funds, either directly by state institutions and grant making agencies 
              or indirectly through the tax code which heavily favors all universities 
              and cultural heritage institutions. If the public is paying for 
              our work, then the public should share some ownership in the results.&#8221; 
              Kelly agrees, going so far as to call open access an obligation: 
              &#8220;I think that as scholars we have an obligation to make our 
              work as freely available as possible, and so open access is an obligation, 
              especially for work supported in any way by money from the taxpayer.&#8221;</p>
            <p><span class="text">The idea that institutions receiving public 
              money should provide public access is raised in a Digital Campus 
              podcast, Episode 32 in September of 2008.<span class="text"><span>[<a name="f4b" id="f4b"></a></span></span></span><a href="#f4" class="back">Fn4</a><span class="text"><span class="text"><span>]</p>

              <p>During the regular news roundup, the men react to the news that 
              the U.S. House of Representatives was considering legislation to 
              reduce public access to research funded by the National Institutes 
              of Health through an NIH database hosted at PubMed Central. There 
              is disgust and disappointment in their voices as they express their 
              opinions that limiting public access to research paid for by the 
              public with taxpayer money is not acceptable. Kelly goes so far 
              as to call it &#8220;criminal,&#8221; pointing out that other, poorer 
              countries rely on information in that database in their scientific 
              communities. The bill, H. R. 6845 (</span><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6845:" class="back">http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:H.R.6845:</a><span class="text">), 
              was sent to the House Committee on the Judiciary.</span></p>
            <p class="text">Cohen, Scheinfeldt, and Kelly are aware that their 
              positions on open access are not widely held in the humanities. 
              When asked about the gap on these issues between humanities and 
              sciences, Cohen was clear: &#8220;Yes, there's a gap. It's probably 
              because 1) scientists have always been more tech savvy; 2) there 
              is a long tradition of monographs in fields like lit and history, 
              whereas the article rules in STM [science, technology, and medicine]; 
              3) humanities scholars tend to be more on the luddite side of things--i.e., 
              a lot of my colleagues think that tech is ruining the humanities.&#8221; 
              Scheinfeldt agreed and went on to say, &#8220;Dan is right on about 
              the differences between the culture of scientific publication and 
              that of humanities publication. I'd add the fact that at least since 
              the 19th century when science started to become &quot;big science,&quot; 
              science has been a necessarily collaborative business requiring 
              efficient modes of communication and knowledge sharing. There's 
              also a special premium placed on priority in the sciences, which 
              drives scientists to publicize their discoveries as quickly as possible.&#8221;</p>
            <p><span class="text">To date, it remains unclear what large scale 
              open access publishing in the humanities would look like. This topic 
              is addressed in Digital Campus Episode 29, from July of 2008 <span class="text"><span>[<a href="#f5"><a name="f5b" id="f5b"></a></a></span></span></span><a href="#f5" class="back">Fn5</a><span class="text"><span class="text"><span>]</span></span>, 
              during which Kelly speaks about his recent blog posts regarding 
              making digital scholarship count in the academic world. Kelly makes 
              a distinction between digital work and digital scholarship, saying 
              that digital scholarship must have the same characteristics as print 
              scholarship: the work is a product of research, is embedded in a 
              conversation among scholars, is peer reviewed, is made public, and 
              has an argument. Scheinfeldt adds that &#8220;if scholars and other 
              people working at universities and libraries and museums are making 
              an argument that the nature of scholarly and academic work has changed 
              with digital technology, I think that they have to be willing to 
              accept that the models and terms of academic employment may also 
              change with that&#8221; in regards to tenure and non-tenure positions 
              - a change he feels is completely acceptable. Cohen expresses concern 
              that even with these kinds of changes, the standard narrative format, 
              linear text, is still privileged above other formats. Kelly notes 
              that scholars are in a period of transition, and therefore those 
              wishing to have digital scholarship or scholarship outside the traditional 
              linear format may have to explain the validity of this work to hiring 
              or tenure committees. All three agree on the idea of &#8220;meeting 
              them halfway&#8221; in terms of getting new forms of scholarship 
              accepted, an plan that can certainly be applied by those wishing 
              to gain acceptance for open access publishing.</span></p>
            <p><span class="text">The works of Cohen, Scheinfeldt, and Kelly, 
              including the Digital Campus podcast and projects at the Center 
              for History and New Media, are an important addition to the academic 
              humanities conversation. They recognize and discuss the changes 
              already happening in their fields in order to evaluate how the humanities 
              community can best position itself to thrive in the future, and 
              they make it clear that it is necessary for the humanities to embrace 
              and be actively involved in shaping change, instead of only voicing 
              objections. The arguments for open access to scholarly work in the 
              humanities are indeed both practical and political. These digital 
              humanists recognize that such a major shift in publishing will have 
              to answer questions about access, how new publishing models fit 
              in with tenure and faculty activities, and how to maintain credibility 
              and the highest standards for publishing. Such questions cannot 
              be left only to publishers and vendors to decide; other humanities 
              scholars must engage in these discussions so that their ideas and 
              interests can help shape the future of the field.

              &#8220;Information content made freely and universally available 
              via the Internet in easy to read format, usually because the publisher 
              maintains online archives to which access is free or has deposited 
              the information in a widely known open access repository. Open access 
              is a new model of scholarly publishing developed to free researchers 
              and libraries from the limitations imposed by excessive subscription 
              price increases for peer-reviewed journals, particularly in the 
              sciences and medicine. By breaking the monopoly of publishers over 
              the distribution of scientific research, open access makes access 
              to scientific information more equitable and has the added advantage 
              of allowing the author to retain copyright.&#8221;</span><span class="text"><br>
